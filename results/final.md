## V. MODEL ANALYSIS INSIGHTS

### What Made DeepSeek Superior:
1. **Critical thinking** - Didn't shy away from identifying dangerous hospitals
2. **Evidence-based** - Every claim supported with actual quotes
3. **Patient safety focus** - Prioritized warning patients over diplomatic language
4. **Comprehensive** - Covered all aspects systematically
5. **Actionable** - Clear "prefer/avoid" guidance

### Why Other Models Fell Short:
- **Over-optimism bias** - Ranked problematic hospitals too highly (GPT-4o Mini, Llama 3.3)
- **Inconsistency** - Rankings contradicted recommendations (Llama 3.1)
- **Superficiality** - Lacked detailed analysis (Claude Haiku)
- **Processing issues** - Truncated outputs (Qwen)
- **Speed vs accuracy tradeoff** - Fastest models were least accurate

### Key Lesson:
For medical analysis, **thoroughness and critical assessment matter more than processing speed**. Patient safety requires calling out problems clearly, not diplomatic hedging.
