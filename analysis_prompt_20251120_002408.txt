In BLK don't know why CGHS site never opens and patients could not be registered as patient of that empanelled hospital to avail cashless treatment. Other hospitals already registered the patients and I have received message regarding this. Many CGHS beneficiaries are strangled for billing and finally land up in making payment for treatment. So much hardships faced by CGHS beneficiaries. They need to take suitable action in this regard that CGHS site works properly in their hospital. My treatment is getting delayed because of this."

Our house is 10 mins away from BLK therefore we chose BLK but within hospital it take resident doctors over 30 mins to attend the patient. The doctors come in and tell us that you are not in a hotel that you would be attended quickly. Today the kid was bleeding profusely due to umbilical cord dislocation but doctor took 48 to mins to check, in between we took him to NICU to get help but the doctor in NiCU told us to go back to room and wait as he won\u2019t see the baby because he was not under him and registered under different doctor."

My uncle was admitted to BLK hospital because he was having some serious issue, so he had to be admitted for around 5-6 days. Of course staying in the hospital for quite a long time was not my cup of tea and I never like hospital's because the staffs and doctors they have some serious ego issues that need to be fixed. But this one Doctor completely threw my thoughts out of the window, every morning he does his rounds so cheerfully which lightens up the mood of the patients and even the attendants coz as a family even we go through a lot of things. So down to earth always ready to clear our doubts, he always have this smile on his face, no matter how many questions we throw he always catch them all. One of my brother is a doctor and he is planning to go for specialist and he said he wanted to be like the Doctor he has become an inspiration for him. I believe doctors should not only use their brains while dealing with a patient need to give room for the heart too to listen. Dr Chandragouda Dodagoudar (Medical Oncology) may you become an inspiration and a hope to many like you have been to us."

He didn\u2019t examine her properly, was in a hurry, ridiculed her concerns and never bothered to answer her any queries. He was so unprofessional even after paying so much for the consultation, like he was doing her a favour. The same applies for the physiotherapy, rather than answering her question, all they wanted to do was show her the package for treatment saying \u201c we\u2019ll tackle it, you should sign the package\u201d no wonder doctors get beaten by the patients. They take their ego to such a high level and their rudeness is unbearable. And before anyone point finger for doctor violence, I am an MBBS doctor too, and have worked in governor hospital. There is no situation where you have to consult a patient in that manner."

After a week of antibiotics dose when i visited again he didn't even bothered to look at the infected area and continued the dermocalm lotion, the lotion is good for a week but after that it needs some moisturizer and not that itchy one. My pain got worse then i visited private dermatologist and there i got better treatment. Please don't visit this Sr dermatologist Hemant Sharma if you want to get cured."

Dr. Sargam attended my father when his BP was 190/80 they gave medication ( Tab Amlogard 5 MG + Arkamin 5 MG ) and advise us to wait for an hour meanwhile they investigate the ECG on the side bed which was in the passing way of other patients and attendant. But god gracefully ECG was absolutely fine as per Dr. Mayank who was available at the emergency desk.\n\nAfter almost 1 hr they allotted a bed (Bed No. 9) we waited patiently over there and the BP was 180/80.\n\nAgain they repeated the medicine Amrogard 5 MG around 6 pm and advise us to wait for another hour. There was no other investigation that has been made not even the temperature check by the nursing staff except the medication, ECG, and bed allotment till 7 pm. We requested them to connect the Monitor so that we can also check the BP and Pulse rate. But they paid deaf ears to all our requests and we were left with no other option. After so many requests to Dr. and nursing staff to monitor my father's BP they came up with cannula when I asked why is this needed they told me we have to inject 2 gastric infections. After this activity, they check the BP again, and it was 170/80, and then they injected one more injection to low down his BP, and that all they have done.\n\nAround 7:15 Dr. Mayank approached us not to check my father but to advise admission, when we ask the reason he said Dr. Sargam suggested it so, but we denied it as my father was feeling perfectly fine and ECG was also fine.\n\nHe again suggested us to wait for an hour and again we waited patiently. At 8:15 we requested them to discharge my father and around 8:30 we got the bill of 6030 INR.\n\nIt was a great shock to us as we had to pay such a big amount at the emergency center for 3 tablets + 3 injections + ECG and a Cannula worth Rs 800 - 1000.\n\nMoreover, when we saw the bill summary the 1st thing we noticed was laboratory service charges which are related to sugar added to my bill worth Rs 1370, and these investigations were never done as I was standing next to my father throughout his admission.\n\n2nd thing we have noticed was the Triage Charges worth Rs 1800 added to my bill just to use their Emergency Bed.\n\n3rd thing which we have noticed is the consultation fee worth Rs 600 at the emergency ward and as per my past experience I had never ever paid any consultation fee at BLK Emergency.\n\n4th thing we have noticed was under the medical consumables section in which every higher amount of consumable is double charged.\n\nAfter checking the bill copy we raised our concern to the billing department they suggested we visit and meet M.O.D, we visited him in his room and discuss the matter. He was literally shouting at me saying we really don\u2019t like people who came up with such complaints once their patients get well. We told him to be polite and professional as we are talking about our concerns. He gave the explanation that no doctors and nurses can provide you details for the treatment to be given to your patient. He was not willing to listen to our concerns and said that I can only waive off Rs 600 from your bill now please go and pay Rs 5430.\n\nLet me be very clear that this M.O.D was extremely rude and unprofessional. I did not want to bother my father so I paid the amount and leave the hospital.\n\nAs per my previous experience, I believed BLK was a reputed hospital and I always prefer to visit BLK for all our health issues. But this time I noticed BLK is also giving a false or dummy report for the investigations.\n\nIn my case, I received a false report for the investigation which had never happened throughout the admission. That too we receive when we questioned about the investigation charges. I have never come across such an awful experience with BLK hospital. This time I m extremely disappointed with your services, unprofessional behaviour, and unjustified charges.\n\nI want you to go through with this case and do the needful asap. I know my rights very well so it\u2019s a request to return my amount which you have taken unethically.\n\nPlease contact me with the earliest resolution to my concern on my below-mentioned details.\n\nName: Rashi Shinh\n\nContact No.: 958203XXXX\n\nEmail ID: rashi.sxxxx@gmail.com"

We were charged One Lac rupees for 7 days Covid treatment as per CGHS rate despite having permission. As the billing staff denied that the permission has been submitted in completion. They kept on digging loopholes or else I say finding loopholes to grab a huge sum of money. They are butchers waiting for golden geese.\n\nThe staff is useless, careless and rude. They discharge people without conducting negative Covid tests and when a surgical patient goes for follow up the billing team and doctors insult them for not showing negative Covid report to them. Why on first incident, they discharge patients saying everything is normal if they are not sure and need to see a negative report, which patients are solely responsible to get it done. They forget to give food when patients are hospitalized for days in ward. The nursing staff need reminders from attendents again and again.\n\nInsulting senior citizens and dening further treatment because the patient was declared once Covid positive is in their imbibe values. The billing staff, on fetching one lac rupees from a retired CGHS beneficiary despite permission for cashless treatment, asks the attendants to give in writing that they have submitted one lac rupees in cash on their own wish, is disgusting. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO AVAIL TREATMENT IN THE HAND OF THESE BUTCHERS WAITING FOR GOLDEN GHEESE AT ALL.\n\n#ENTDept #OperationManager #FloorManager #Coordinators #NursingStaff #BLKHospital #Delhi #ButchersWaitingForSnatchingHugeSumOfMoney #CGHSBeneficiary #CGHSpanel"

My mother was treated without reasons by Dr Subhash chandra (Cardiology) and though at the operation theatre her veins were punctured but procedure was not due to \"No Requirement\", this was feedback of junior doctor doing the laser procedure. We had to pay all expenses of procedure. After four days when my mother had continuity of fever we went to him with new blood reports, he shood us away like dogs, \"while we are standing he said, yeh fever hai apko, yeh mera department nahi hai, consult doctor in medicine\". NOW coming to \"Gold Digger\" situation. Dr Subhash chandra asked me if I want to make a reasonable billing then I need to buy catheter which are used for procedure from outside chemist. I said fine as it may save me money. I got a call from his assitant sanjeev who refered me to a medical supplier called Nilesh. Nilesh quote was one lakh and after small negotiation he gave to me for 48000. He refused bill and said that he will deliver catheters to doctor directly. Now when the procedure was not done I asked to refund, the medical supplier told me that 12000 plust shall be refunded and he did. The whole episode is true and recorded. These kind of doctors are a curse to our system."

But after the injection was given he started having oxygen problem then he was shifted to HDU on 6 floor and in few hrs his BP was drastically down which surpised us as he never had BP n Sugar throughtout his life n never had medicines for these.And they shifted him to ICU stating this oxgen mask is not sufficing here n he is becoming restless and few hrs later on to ventilator.we only came for getting all tests done n diagniosing the issue and take proper medication but within few hrs our whole life changed and after being on ventilator for 02 days he left all of us in pain and grief.This is result of no proper treatment n all started with injection given by nurse and after that these guys couldn't normailze n his condition detroited with each passing minute.Most importantly they will come up with ideas to provide added machinery which costs as good as 60 to 70k per day n want to put on observation for 15 days.And these machines will not improve the situation rather will make money for Hospital.\n\nShameless creatures rather I doubt they have any humanity left in their souls."

Today my reviews related to a hospital which is named as Blk super speciality Hospital it is located in Delhi as we all know Delhi is famous for the qualities of hospital present here like all India medical, panth etc . So let's get started with the review of this Hospital .\n\nThe first thing which comes in our mind is the medical care which is most important for a hospital. My experience regarding this hospital was started 4 months ago when I admitted my friends grandmother in this Hospital . She was suffering from high blood pressure and her condition was not in control at that time. For the admission process they they charged a big amount from us . And also do a lot of test most of which are not connected with the problem .\n\nThe next thing is the infrastructure of a Hospital the infrastructure was good the hospital is very well constructed and you will find every machine which is required for a most typical patient to recover. But the administration of the hospital is words you will find a long chain of people connected to each other in the main hall for registration and completing documents to get their patient admitted in the hospital . The staff is not much in quantity to meet all of their requirements .\n\nThe sad thing is the staff and doctors behaviour and attitude towards the customers that is the patient and their relatives and loved ones. The receptionist was very much rule to the family members and loved ones of the patients .\n\nAt the last I will not suggest you to go to this hospital for small injuries common diseases and surgeries . It is very much expensive also which I forgot to write in the above aspects ."

The problem was minor as they had to insert a needle into the kidney from outside to drain all the puss that had accumulated there.\n\nFor that they did a whole Xray and MRI twice alongwith blood tests which was not required. It costed 90k Rs for that simple process and they kept the person admitted for 6 days.\n\nThe private hospitals like Blk make you stay there for days beacause the rooms which are rented are rented on daily basis. The more a patient stay the more they earn.\n\nServices are high end like a 5 star hotel but they all do that at a high cost which are not affordable by middle class people."

        "review": "BLK Hospital is primarily for rich folk and foreigners from Arab and African countries. Rest of the folks will get the right treatment. but at a huge price.\nInfrastructure: Decent. Better than Ganga Ram Hospital. To visit a patient only one person can go inside the patient ward. Strict checking is done. Cannot take food inside. There is a sleeping room with couches for 15-20 people at a separate section for those who cannot sleep with the patient on the small bench.\nRooms: Rooms are decent sized. 6-8 bed rooms are pathetic. No place to sleep or stand. For 3/2 rooms there is decent space but the other patient/relatives keep coming and going. shouting and having party. Even though only 1 person is allowed and only 2 are allowed during visiting hours. the crowd cannot be controlled by security. We had many fights with other people coming in huge numbers and putting TV on high volume and talking loudly. They forget that its a hospital and not their chai time masti.\nMedical care: Decent. Just like other hospitals 2-3 doctors and dieticians will visit the room for no reason and make 500-600 bucks per visit. Keep check on the medicines and apparatus being brought by nurses. Take the bills which are thrown away in the cupboard.\nBilling: Worst counter. Prepare yourself 1-2 weeks beforehand if you have insurance. Get all approvals done. Huge number of people standing in lines for billing.\nProblems: BIGGEST problem is its blood bank. They have a blood bank that provides tested approved blood for the surgery of your patient. The problem is that they ask for as much blood from the person accompanying the patient. So, for example if your parent is admitted and has to go through surgery that day. since morning you will be hounded to give 4-5 units of blood(find other relatives who have no tattoos, BP, diabetes etc) ASAP.\nThere is no proof whether that much amount is being used or not. Secondly, you cannot buy that blood from them. you have to give them 4-5 units(depending on what they ask). Thirdly, you cannot buy blood from outside blood banks. YOU HAVE TO DONATE BLOOD. In my case I was stressed. had not slept for 3-4 days. and was running around begging people to donate blood. And the blood bank lady was enjoying her mobile movie.\n\nAnd on top of this scandal. they billed thousands of rupees for that blood. I was shocked. when I went to the billing section they told me that the blood given to the patient goes through several tests and is 100% pure. So not only are you paying for that. you are also replacing that blood. Stupidity.\n\nAll in all. whichever hospital you go to. you are screwed. If you are attendant of a patient you are screwed further. You have to run from pillar to post for many things. If you get 2 minutes of relaxation time. that is disturbed as you are sleeping on a bench next to the patient and are disturbed by nurses coming and going."

But When he got it again so we thought to get it treated permanently from the best hospital in Delhi. So we reached Blk hospital after searching on internet.And then they started performing all kinds of tests, half of which had already been performed in the previous hospitals. But they didn't care We showed them all the reports from previous hospitals and but they continued performing tests. And then decided to perform a surgery to permanently cure Jaundice under the leadership of Dr. Yogesh Batra.They assured us everything will be fine and Jaundice will go forever. So after the surgery everything was ok and we took my brother home with all the medicines which were very strong,\n\nSo my brother ate the medicines for a week as instructed and then his stomach started aching, So we took him to hospital again. Unfortunately it was sunday. Dr Yogesh Batra was at home. So my mother called Dr Batra and asked him to come to the hospital and take a look at my brother.Instead of showing humanity by helping my brother he told that there was a team of doctors who will attend to him. But this team of doctors was nothing but a team of toddlers and without proper investigation they went ahead and performed a surgery performed another surgery claiming that there is a hole in the intestine, but they couldn't find anything and it was a wild guess. But this surgery weakened my brother and he was in icu with 100% ventilation.\n\nThen started the flow of medicine and blood.They gave my brother 21 bottles of blood along platelets. Where my brother was perfectly fine and now he was in icu in critical condition.after a few days we got to know that the nurses were not doing their duties properly, specifically one male nurse \" Tony Mathew\".My brother went ahead and termed this nurse a \"monster\". He even told us that these people are performing all kinds of experiment and will take his life eventually. But we trusted the reputation of hospital and the doctors. Our trust broke when of their own employees told us that something is not right. So we along with our family members went and lodged a complaint with senior management, they gave all kinds of excuses. Then they summoned Dr Batra, the moment we saw him, he couldn't face us.We could see the guilt in his eyes.\n\nRight after this incident they shifted him to the medical icu, where my brother gave up due to complete carelessness of the doctors and the nursing staff.\n\nThey claim to having the best of all the world, but it's just the machine they have, rest the staff is the worst and insensitive. They know how to mint money.Even though money was never an issue but life is not a game which can be equated with life. This is not a hospital but a place where murders take place in a legal form and they are paid in excess amount to do it.\n\nI am sure many might think that I am biased as he was my brother but I am saying the truth. If you love your loved ones do not think of going here as they will start with all the tests and end up by saying we cannot do much so please take him to any other hospital and finally they will take the life of your loved one.\n\nI just wish I had never taken brother to this hospital."

Giving full marks for then tremendous care and support to the patient.!\n\nDr. B L Kapur, an eminent Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, set up a Charitable Hospital in 1930 at Lahore. In 1947, he moved to post-partition India and set up a Maternity Hospital at Ludhiana. In 1956 on the invitation of the then Prime Minister, Dr. B L Kapur initiated the project for setting up a 200 bed hospital in Delhi. The hospital was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru on 2nd January, 1959.\n\nBy 1984, when the hospital celebrated its Silver Jubilee, it was an expanding hospital well on its way to becoming Delhi\u2019s premier multispecialty institute. Services offered included General Surgery, Ophthalmology, ENT, Dentistry, Pulmonology, Intensive Care and Orthopedics, apart from mother & child care.\n\nA factor of much importance to the hospital was the health of the community. Enthusiastic doctors held camps and public health talks to improve the status of community health in the area.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Trustees of the hospital felt the need to upgrade it to a tertiary care hospital and tied up with Radiant Life Care Private Limited to re-develop and manage the facility. Today, a modern state-of-the-art tertiary care hospital has come up in place of the old hospital. It is one of the biggest stand alone private Hospitals in the National Capital Region today."

They take 1.5 lakh from us and gave us the dead body.\n\nI am right now just crying or abusing the fuc*ing doctors!\n\n*Please don't ever go to this hospital I beg you. If u don't want to lose your loved ones.*\n\nWaheguru ji ka Khalsa\n\nWaheguru ji ki fateh"

We received very warm welcome at the reception. The staff was very cooperative and guided us all the way.\n\nWhen my father was admitted we were afraid of high treatments costs as the infrastructure was very good, though we were ready to pay any amount we could have afforded. But when doctor visited us and we told him about our situation, he assured me of everything and told me not to worry. And we had face bare minimum tests and examinations.  We faced no extra charges for anything, be it medical, tests or other stuff.\n\nAfter surgery my father had no symptoms of cancer and we after a week of salary we were released from the hospital. We are highly satisfied with the services of BLK Hospital, Delhi."

        "review": "I shudder every time I think of the 4 days I spent in BLK hospital, and I hope no one has to go through the trauma that we had to endure. My father was admitted to this hospital from 21 Mar - 24 Mar 2013, as his oncologist, a doctor for who we have a lot of respect, consults here.\n\nOn the day of admission, we were informed he needs a PET scan the next day to rule out the recurrence of cancer - however, this ultra modern hospital does not have a PET machine which they conveniently forgot to mention, and so my father - a 67 year old diabetic and cancer patient who had been admitted to the hospital in the first place for treatment of high fever and extreme weakness - was taken to Ganga Ram hospital where there were at least 10 other patients, leading to a very long and tiring wait for my father - on account of this, he was also made to stay on an empty stomach (not even any water) for nearly 10 hours, the procedure finally concluding after 3 PM!\n\nThe same day, we were informed that he needs to undergo an endoscopy and they had fixed an appointment for him for the the next day at 9AM - he was also asked to fast overnight for the endoscopy, and were told it's a very short 5 - 10 minute procedure. He was taken to the endoscopy machine room at 9 AM and my sister who was the attendant was asked to wait outside. She waited for nearly 2 hours - each time she enquired with the department nurse, she was told he was undergoing the procedure.\n\nFinally, at 11 AM my father called my sister and informed her that he was being shuttled from one place to another and the procedure was yet to begin! When my sister confronted the attending staff, they informed her that they were cleaning the machines - can you imagine that they called a 67 year diabetic & cancer patient who could barely sit for a procedure that takes only 5 minutes and made him wait for over 2 hours to clean their machines!\n\nFinally, it emerged that the doctor who was supposed to the procedure, a Dr Vij, had been missing and the cleaning of the machine was just an excuse, with no thought for the poor suffering patient. Finally, the procedure was completed around 12.30 PM when it could have easily been finished by 9 AM  - and on account of the delay my father had also gone without food for over 12 hours for the second consecutive day.\n\nIn between all of this, there were a whole host of tests done on my father, many of which seemed to be un-necessary to us. When we questioned the need for some of the tests - the resident doctor said that anything could be possible and they didn't want to rule anything out - of course anything is possible but the job of a doctor is to pin point the 2-3 areas that are most likely, especially when the patient has been under your observation for over 3 days.\n\nThey would take blood samples from my extremely weak father 2-3 times a day and on the evening on which we expected him to be discharged (Saturday Marrch 23) we were informed that he has low Hb and needs blood transfusion  (He had already been given two units of blood in Feb and his Hb was normal just a day ago as tested at the hospital) - maybe he wouldn't have needed this if the resident doctor was a little less eager to do all possible tests in the world. On account of the 3 hour delay in endoscopy by the hospital and the insistence of the blood transfusion, ours discharge was pushed to the next day.\n\nOn the day of discharge, I noticed that the hospital had overlooked billing for the PET scan. I was foolish enough to bring it to the attention of the billing team - as on account of their oversight we had to spend an additional 4 hours at the hospital as they send revised bills to the insurance company without bothering to explain to them that they had made a mistake in billing.\n\nThe issue finally got resolved after I made numerous calls to the insurance company and demanded that a senior person take charge. I also demanded to meet the MS or the Astt MS, but I was told both were not in hospital. Incidentally, while I was going through this nightmare in billing, another couple were loudly complaining about the ineffectiveness of the hospital.\n\nThe nursing staff in the ward is completely clueless about what is going on and also did not appear very competent  - they kept on moving the canula on my father's arm and a couple of times there was bleeding from the canula that they failed to notice and I had to call them to fix it.\n\nAnd finally, the hospital security - some of the security guards behave like they are bouncers at a pub and the poor harried attendant who is running around from floor to floor on account of the sheer all-round incompetence of the hospital is treated with extreme rudeness for things like daring to forget the attendant pass!\n\nI find nothing, absolutely nothing, to recommend about this hospital - all they have is a fancy building and LOTS of \"staff\" but not one of that staff is either competent or polite.\n\nI repeat, it is better to stay at home and do nothing than go to this hospital, because going to this hospital will make you poorer in health and in bank balance."

Dr Anil Bhan a kotex cardio came for a visit to srinagar and he advised an emergency surgery at Medanta and told that he would go for grafts and normalise blood flow . 14 November 2019 my father was admitted and Dr Anil Bhan changed his statement and advised for an open heart first . On completion of the surgery he again advised to be prepared for limb surgery that was already advised and performed limb surgery after 4 days without ascertaining the condition of patient . After limb surgery they told us the patient is fine but he developed swelling in the body that was termed as a normal post operative symptom that later worsened. Dr Firdous from Kulgam kashmir was addressing us and he continued with his inhuman procedures . Dr Firdous is the way to divert kashmiri patients . He was givin the duty to deal with us . When we complained about the condition of the patient they diagnosed him of acute pancriatites as they performed a CT that was never shared with us, after 5 painful days they changed the statement and diagnosed the patient of SEPSIS and put him on ventilator . When the condition of the patient worsened they accepted that they had ruptured a gut while performing surgery and within a week performed another surgery taking it to 3 surgeries instead of one. In these 38 days they killed us everyday moving the patient to ICU on ventilator and number of surgeries making a good amount of money from it. On the 38th day on Dec 21 my father expired just because MEDANTA had to make money, now i sometimes think that they might have taken out his organs also . Just because they had to make money they killed my father and it\u2019s not only my father but many patients might have faced it or will face it . The killers of my father Dr Anil Bhan, Dr Firdous, Dr Ather\n\nI request to everyone please do not go to this hospital if u want to save a life\n\nIt happened with me and i don\u2019t want this to happen with anyone else\n\nIf anyone has any question call 9682152554"

After seeing her, Dr. Sood recommended to admit her immediately to the ward and we did so. She was admitted at 10:56am and doctors team came for visiting around 4pm. Till then she was in great pain. After examining doctors suggested for the surgery and said we need the previous CT scan films by tomorrow and left. Whole night she was given just normal salines and DNS and metrogyl iv infusions.\n\n7th January around 4am, she was not feeling well at all. I told sisters to check her but they said they do regular checkup for all patients around 6-7am and i have to wait. I was not even allowed to check her blood tests reports. They were so rude. Her bp started to fall down and then they call doctor and took decision to shift her to ICU9.\n\nThe worst phase of my mothers life actually started from there. When they took her to ICU9, they asked me to sign consent form for centre line arterial line and ventilator. They were so prepared in advance for what to do with the patients. They tried there hands on and on and around 10am they told me that they examined her through XRay (which we never got) and found that her intestine got ruptured and immediately need to operate her. With no other option left, we allowed and operation on high risk was done for 3hours.\n\nThey told she is fine and maintaing her bp but still in danger. We saw her graph of improvement going for 5 days. On the 6th day of operation, they took her for CTScan on UG floor andshe was exposed to infections and on such an unstable condition they performed SLEDD dialysis. Her bp again fluctuated from this. From that only her health started to deteriorate. Again after 8hours of sledd session, just to make money, they told me to pay for CRRT dialysis. We agreed. But again her bp started to fluctuate and this time she couldnot fight back and she died.\n\nI cant explain how much in pain she was. They just treated her like an experimenting body. They inserted one catherer one one side other cattherer from the other side. Whole body was actually punched. She was a great fighter but couldnot fight the pain the medanta people gave. She was conscious and wanted to speak, she wanted them to open her she tried she expressed but these people were so so so sooooo heatless that they didnt even care. Unfortunately she left.\n\nAnd talking about the transparency, everything in this hospital is just soooo one sided. Being attendant you will not even get to know what are they giving to your patient. They have 1 counselling session in the morning for 5min and 2visinting hours for 15 each. Other than that whatever they are doing is just in their hands and is just so one sided. But during her last hours, they called me to show that they are trying to give her chest compressions. Just to be assure and show that they are trying.\n\nPlease Please Please do not go to this hospital ever ever in your life. Please save your patients life by not going there. They are just so rude mean and know how long they can stretch treatment to earn money. All medanta people whom I dealt with are just a ms. I could have saved my mothers life if i would not have been to medanta where they just did experiments on my mothers body.\n\nPlease do not ever go.... this is not just my story but is a case with every single person standing in front of ICU9. Doctors have told to almost every family that ur patient is suffering from serious infection and we couldnt find culture and antibiotics are not working. The same case with everybody. But do not go to this hospital ever. Use your money wisely and save a life."

He advised me to get CT scan done in medanta as according to him medanta gives better n detailed report..... Money was not issue for me as I was seeking best in every aspect of treatment.... Cost of CT scan was Rs 10000 (almost double cost of normal diagnostic center) same day they provide me the report and as a doctor I can say that way of reporting was not up to the mark.... It was similar to what my most of known beginner radiology student friends make.......as a doctor I can point out mistakes\n\n1)Kidney cysts are classified on Bosniak grading but they didn't give grading of my cyst\n\n2)it was contrast enhanced CT scan.. And ironically they didn't comment on contrast enhancement in cyst...\n\nI tried to meet radiologist who reported my CT But supporting staff was always there to misled you... First they said you can meet radiologist.... Later they said radiologist don't meet anyone....\n\nFinally I consulted my treating physician there.. And he also seemed to be in hurry n no more interested in counseling...... As a doctor there were lots n lots of questions in mind but I wanted to discuss on 4 or 5 things... But he got irritated from starting so I didn't ask him anything...\n\nThis was the experience of a doctor in such big corporate hospital of big city.... God help those common man who don't have much knowledge in medical science..... I can say that I don't know about other people but in my case it was not good experience..

It\u2019s a beautiful place where these Doctors conduct there business. If you are planning to go there for the treatment I would highly suggest otherwise as you might be bankrupt after the treatment. Doctors are extremely unprofessional with nurses, they talk to them like they are dogs, but well what else you can hope in India. It\u2019s deeply rooted in there mental structure that nurses are not human beings and all they do is filthy jobs. But well neither do doctor respect nurses nor do nurses respect other nurses. They talk in a very disrespecting manner most of the time. Now let\u2019s talk about the treatment they provide there. Doctors and nurses lie to there patients all the time. The treatment and care level is not even average. Like I said there are not doing humanitarian jobs it\u2019s just money hoarding business.

Sharing below my experience of this nasty Hospital so that people could get to know about the reality of it.\n\nDR. Praveen Chandra was recommended by our Doctor for the treatment. DR. Praveen Chandra suggested that EPS RFA must be performed. But he didn't perform it himself, it was done by a Junior Doctor.\n\nAt the time of discharge, neither DR. Chandra nor the Doctor who performed surgery, visited even once to check the condition of my mother.\n\nAssistant of Dr. Chandra had advised Nurses to prepare my mother for Surgery(Blood test, ECG) to be performed. I was busy in other formalities of Hospital and when returned after 2 hours I got to know from the assistant that Surgery can't be performed today as the nurses had not prepared my mother for the surgery.\n\nWhen asked nurses why this was not done, they replied that they were not instructed by the doctors as to what preparations were required. Doctors were busy in Gossiping with each other and Whatsup.\n\nDuring Surgery, my mother was kept awake as it was required. She got terrified when another colleague of doctors started coming inside, again and again, asking \"AREY ABHI TAK KHATM NAHI HUA\".\n\nThe doctor also said once during surgery \"ARREY WO COMPONENT NAHI MIL RAHA, USSEY DHUNDO\".\n\nSince I shared my negative feedback with their staff members, I was not even given a feedback form Staff who takes care of Refund is rude and doesn't know how to speak to the visitors\n\nI had given my Aadhar Card photocopy for a refund and also received a refund voucher in which my complete name Narender Singh Bisht was printed, still, I received a cheque in the name of Narender Singh which couldn't be cleared. Now Mr. Sunil Kumar who takes care of all these things says that policy has been changed and cheque can be released only in the name of the patient.\n\nThere is no place in the hospital where Poor and Middle-class family could eat inside. There are 2 cafeterias in the hospital which has famous food joint but nothing which could be served to the poor and middle-class family. A samosa with tea would cost you Rs.124\n\nTherefore, I request people to be cautious while visiting this hospital for treatment. They are more interested in giving treatment to offshore patient and money making. The hospital is already receiving much negative feedback which is indeed true.\n\nPatient ID - MM01276106"

I think the name and fame of the hospital has gone high upto such an extent that nobody bothers about the way the hospital is working and its effects on the patients and family.\n\nI had recently been to Medanta Gurugram for my Mother's Total knee replacement surgry which was previously reviewed and scheduled for surgery by Dr SKS Marya a month before. But due to the negligence of surgeon and no cooperation and coordination among staffs and other departments we cancelled the surgery and discharged my mother because we were in no mood for taking chances or being an experimental animal. Pointers on what made us took this decision are mentioned below:\nDr SKS Marya never turned up to visit the patient even for 5 mins before the scheduled surgery.\nJuniors doctors took the matters in hand and kept us informing that Dr Marya will visit the patient on rounds but never happened.\nJunior doctors kept lying and finally when we confronted a day before the surgery one doctor accepted that Dr Marya wont be operating on my mother but some other doctor will.\nRadiologist during xray and cardiologist during the echo test questioned my mother that why are you getting TKR surgery done because you are fit and fine and its not indicative in you. But when my mother said that Dr SKS Marya has given a go for surgery they kept quiet and said please dont take our names in front of doctor. Patient lost will and trust for the surgery.\nWe wanted to talk to dr Marya on phone but was told that we can't and when we said we want a discharge then Dr Marya himself called on some junior doctor's phone and said he wanted to talk to us. Inspite of telling everything he never turned up and said if you dont want to get the surgery done you can go and come back when you wish to.\nMy question being a doctor is this the way how operating doctor behaves with the patient? Is he so confident about his skills that without visiting the patient and doing a clinical examination he will directly see the patient in OT? Patients comes from far off places just on name of Dr Marya and is it good to transfer cases to junior doctor without patient's knowledge and consent?\n\nMedanta Medicity hospital management, you may a 7 star hospital and you may have state of the art interiors and facilities with advanced medical equipments but its all of no use if your doctors and staffs are not upto the mark. Its same like if the cook is overconfident and negligent he will make worst food even if he is working in a start hotel with advanced equipments and techniques.\n\nFor me its a no no for Medanta Medicity hospital\n\n-Dr Rahul Kumar"

My mother went to Medanta on her feet as she was having pain due to bowel moment in her stomach. We first met Dr.Rxxxxx Sxx(The murdered) with her reports the first thing he said was \u201cshe has to get the operation immediately and ask us to admit her at that time only.\u201d And we on the concern about our mother could not understand that it was just a trap to get he admitted in the hospital. Then they did operation and put a colostomy bag on her stomach and ask us to come after three months for checkup so that they can remove the bag. After two months we took our mother again to the Medanta hospital(DAAKU) but at that time Dr. Rxxxxx Sxx was not there and we have to meet Dr. Rxxxxx Pxxx(THE KASAI) he also ask us to admit her in the hospital(DAAKU). After couple of days when Dr. Rxxxxx Pxxx(THE KASAI) came on the round in the evening he then said everything is fine and he told us that she is improving so fast and her BP, Sugar, Pulse ETC all are normal now and they ll do the ultrasound tomorrow and then they ll plan to remove that colostomy bag. We feel so relax that time. Next day they shifted our mother to scanning room and without our consent just in greed of money they started doing endoscopy test of our mother.(Later we consulted other doctors and they said they should not have done this endoscopy test as there is no need of it that time.) and during that endoscopy test their unskilled trainee doctor Dr. Vxxxxx(xxxxxx) puncture the intestine while doing the endoscopy test and they didn\u2019t even tried tell us this thing and suddenly after the test our mother started to get dizzy her BP was abnormal suddenly and her pulse was so low that time. We asked them and they didn\u2019t even inform us anything but they also tensed that time and we heard them talking with their team that patients intestine was burst due to endoscopy. A series of junior doctors tried their hands on her. They then came to us and told us that they have to immediately do the operation and And again just to be out of picture and to save themselves they shifted her to ICU. Then after 4\\5 hours they call us and ask us to come outside the operation theatre that surgon said tat operation was unsuccessful and they could not repair the burst intestine and she is on ventilator that time. When we ask them several questions like she was alright in the afteroon now suddenly this thing happen they told us that she ll heal automatically. We were not having any other option that time. When they let us go to see our mom what we saw is she was lot of pipes in her stomach and mouth also they had put centreline on her neck and she was still unconscious that time. In the next morning when she was still in the ICU on ventilator, our mom was not able to speak but she wrote everything on paper that she was well and she was not having any problem of Sugar, BP, Asthma etc and now suddenly she is on ventilator there is something wrong which doctors did. Our mother was then unnecessarily given sedatives in ICU for centre line and some other procedure was getting done on her which was not at all required. We were keep on asking Dr. Rxxxxx Pxxx(THE KASAI) again and again that has happened to her when she was the one, who go for the ultrasound test on her foot and now suddenly she is on ventilator. He just keep on manipulating us by saying fake things to hide their mistake and earn more money from us. Our daily bill was around 1 lakh those days. Then day by day her health was getting more worse and finally when we consulted other doctors about it and when they told us the whole back stage drama we were shocked and ask the doctors of Medanta and then they told us to to get her discharged and take her in an ambulanve to our city. On the bill matter we were told by Dr. Rxxxxx Pxxx(THE KASAI) to meet Axxxxxxx(xxxxxx) for discount as it was hospital staffs fault due to which our mom is in this position now. Then Axxxxxxx played a game with us by sending us to the 11 floor too meet her daughter Rohini for discount and she did the same by sending us to Axxxxxxx. These Mother daughter has played with us like a football for 3/4 days. and on the last from the bill of 18 lakhs they have given us the waiver of 10 k. We sentimentally splash the money on their face and took our patient to our city in ambulance in very poor condition and she was then again directly admitted to another small hospital in our city. She left us all after one week from then. At the last she was killed by Dr. Sxxx(a killer), Dr. Rxxxxx Pxxx(A KASAI), Dr Vxxxxx(xxxxxx)( junior doctors good for nothing- playing with human lives and learning medicine). She came to Medanta walking on her feet and although after paying them 25 lakh rupees she came out in an ambulance. This is all due to negligence/mishandling of the situation by the hospital. We took her for a treatment but they killed her. She went in conscious state since she never came out of sedation .heavy doses of antibiotics and sedation had caused on her brain. I hate the hospital the doctors whose negligence cost my mom her life. Its my request if the doctors are delaying the process, seek another hospital. The quality of the hospital isn't the same anymore. Better check for others opinions. The ICU was a grave where every single day a patient would die. My mom was one of them. I lost her for wrong treatment. We never thought she would never come back.I can\u2019t explain the type of hell this Medanta is- full of infections.(Patients were coming there for some other treatment and were getting problems increased day by day, time by time, every patient is getting bedsol in their ICU. We have to punish them. We are finding ourselfs helpless. Many people are unnecessarily loosing their money because of them. They keep dead bodies of patients who came with hope to get well in intensive care(ICU) just to charge money an d remove evidences to find that the patient died due to errors by doctors, this is not a hospital but a house of criminals and murderers Please help us in punishing these peoples like Dr Sxxx, Dr Pxxx, Dr Vxxxxx Dr Sxxxxx etc. There are lot of people like us who are suffering .Please take some actions against these people. Is it right to play with some ones life for money? please do not do this. Doctor is a noble profession. how much money do you need for living? it will all be left here. Such a Shame. I hope a day will come when Medanta- The Medicity will no more stand up as a hospital. All I can say is that ILost my Mother and my loss was their gain. \u201cJustice is to be prevailed\u201d"

The dr in question was gruff and extremely high handed with us and refused to even look us in the eye while speaking to us.\n\nShe prescribed a series of tests among which there were two biopsies, of which one proved to be unnecessary on seeking other opinions, which later she also admitted was not needed.\n\nAfter admitting my dad and waiting four days we finally managed to get a colonscopy. we had to keep following up to get an update on it. When we finally collected it we were informed it had been ready since days and it was pending clearance due to payment for additional tests that were done. This was shocking as we had been constantly following up and we had been told that we could pay when we came to collect the report. The report showed fast growing small cell lung cancer . We requested to be able to speak to the doctor since time was of importance. She flatly refused and asked that we should book for an opd appointment for Monday . We had to travel more than 40 km from our home in noida to get her views on the report. She told us only palliative chemo was possible. We told her we would prefer to get the treatment in a noida hospital based on her advice as travelling so much was not an option for my dad. She mentioned the chemo that was needed in this case and said we could collect the print out from outside her office.\n\nWe were shocked to see that the opd note had no mention of the chemotherapy she had talked about but only mentioned that we should get an MRI done and meet her again(this wasting several other days again). How long do we have to wait before we can start the chemo that is so obviously required.\n\nWhy would a human being waste time in a case where every day could mean falling immunity and manifestation of more and more symptoms for the patient like effect on bones that she herself highlighted. Only someone who is pure evil would take such sadistic pleasure in playing with emotions of those helpless in the grip of this vicious disease. She's lost the human touch and should be banned from a profession who's primary concern should be to save lives and alleviate pain where the former is not possible."

The outside area is beautifully maintained with flower and garden where people can sit and relax. Inside the building, it is beautiful. Doesn't feel like a hospital. There are eateries as well from KFC to Ccd and many more .\n\nComing to the wards and ICU they are good and also everyday cleaned . Dieticians come and ask you about your diet and give u a proper diet till the time you will be admitted .\n\nEvery three hours they will feed you with some meals . And food is hygienic. They take good care of you.\n\nIt is a bit expensive compared to other hospitals in Delhi and Gurgaon\n\nAs the saying goes everything has its own flaws, even medanta has.\n\nThe staff there are good and hard working but for me when I was admitted in ICU, the second day nurse, who was allotted to me was very rude and didn't even show up when required to do my daily necessities.\n\nBut overall a good hospitality served .ot"

Medical care is a pretty regular to what you get in every private hospitals nowadays. You get medical attention but you have to wait for it for too long. Even if you have an appointment you may have to wait for hours and people without any appointment may be attended before you if they know someone there. Medical care is of a descent level if you get it properly. Staff attitude is too ignorant. They kind of ignore your queries and after running behind them they still do not support you well.

Let me brief the journey \u2026\u2026\n\nAs I used to hold a high of Medanta totally because of the strong panel of Dr. and super specialty services and that was the reason to opt for a medical check up for my mother. As an outcome, the one of the reports reflected that there possibly could be a cardiac problem as a symptom. And then started the journey, tried calling the Medanta hotline but the wire was always hot and I couldn\u2019t really get a slot from the Dr.\n\nCardiac problem is not a usual discussion we have in our families, as a result I had to consult an alternate Cardio surgeon who recommended CT Angio for my mother. As I was Robotouchnded by the flashy building and the thanks to Technology on prompt SMS updates from Medanta, I again chose Medant for CT Angio. As an outcome my mother was recommended that we should go for a detailed angiography.\n\nI again tried reaching out via the hotwire of Medanta, but OPD\u2019s are really difficult nut to crack when you as individual really need something in need. Consulted a friend who had a experience\u201d good\u201d @ medanta and I was introduced to the savior Dr. Anil Bhan via the only good soul I met @ Medanta Mr. Hotil Lal.\n\nI was wow\u2019ed as I got an appointment the same day( March 21\u20192017) and here I am with my mother having an appointment with Dr. Anil Bhan. I was on time, but I was told that a critical surgery in place so I will have to wait though I could see the Dr. walking in and out and meeting patients scheduled. The wait was long one and my watch clocked exactly 1 hour though the Cred824ential of Dr. Bhan in his cabin with his photograph with visionary Late President Abdul Kalam was a good feedforward for me . As a diligent patient, my mother shared the case history to which Mr. Bhan recommended that CT Angio doesn\u2019t make any sense without even looking at the CT Angio and we should go for a detailed angio\u2026 and that\u2019s where as they say the making of the great salad started \u2013 I took an prior appointment for 9:30 AM from Hoti Lal ji to book a Cardio-\n\nMarch 22\u20192017 @ 10: 15 AM\u2026\n\nI reached Medanta late by 20 minutes and Dr. Anil Bhan approved the admission and here we were up for a ride- We reached Admission Desk \u201c2\u201d after the TPA submission and I was told that there is a scarcity of the rooms and I will have to wait for 1 hour. For records, my watch said 11:45 AM at that point of time \u2026.@ 2PM after 3rd reminder I was informed, that some clearance is happening why don\u2019t we go and have some lunch. We had lunch and I had to ask the attendant with a modulated voice and the reply was same that he is trying\u2026to which I reverted that we are done and we left .As a courtesy I informed Mr. Hoti Lal as well on same. As I reached the parking lot, I got a call from the attendant and Mr. Hoti Lal that the room is available now and please come back. I had a chat with my mother and decided that lets go as to a normal operating family a cardio is not like a weather fever you got. I thought its fine I am happy that atleast there is someone bothered as I got to know that the room got upgraded on Dr. request as the other room wasn\u2019t available but finally we got the room @ 3:00PM. I felt \u2026hmm\u2026\n\nDear Sister walked in and took all necessary readings and I was told, we will go for Echo and Angio in sometime. After Echo session, my mother was take for Angio @ 4:30 PM and I accompanied. I was asked to wait outside the lab on Floor 3rd as attendants are not allowed in the lab. I was told its not a major procedure and it will take about 1 hour\u2026. & Then waited.waited.waited\u2026finally @8:00 PM my mother was sent to ICU and I was asked to come after 20 minutes. Neither the criticality or the outcome was shared with me as an attendant on outcome of the angio. I controlled and was able to make my way to ICU and to my surprise what I found was disgusting\u2026.my mother\u2019s bed was aligned to a corner with no one to attend\u2026.remember \u201cDedicated to lives.bla bla bla\u201d with sisters making fun of an international patient as he dint know Punjabi\u2026. On me reminding them that why don\u2019t you move my mother to her room, I was told that they would need a sign off.and that sign off took like over an hour with no dinner served to a diabetic patient. When my mother reached room, I asked her how was the treatment and now comes other bummer\u2026\u2026 she was waiting outside the lab from 4:30 PM to 6:30PM on wheel chair. I was fumed but over neither I was not informed on what to expect whereas other customers who had a severity were recommended a stent at the same time and attendant were called inside.\n\nMarch 23\u20192017 @7:00 AM\u2026.\n\nThe sister came in and we were told that Dr. Bhan is waiting for us in the sisters waiting area. We went there and it was like a role play with Dr. watching a heart beating on monBrianbalakumaranr and we were directed to sit. Dr. Anil Bhan asked my mother on how she feels and she was recommended that we should go for stent as there is a blockage in RCA. I intervened and asked what\u2019s the severity and if Dr. could help me understand how would he define the risk. Dr. shared that there are symptoms and he would recommend an angioplasty. He suggested that we should talk to Dr. Praveen Chandra as he would be conducting the angioplasty. I was never shared what\u2019s the severity and what\u2019s the blockage percentage etc. etc. etc.\n\nAs I wasn\u2019t convinced I shared that we would need a discharge and would not want to go for angioplasty and the interaction changed all of a sudden. A fellow Dr. from Mr. Praveen Chandra\u2019s team came and said in that case Mr. Bhan can only give you discharge and not Mr. Chandra. I again interjected and shared that If we don\u2019t want to go for a procedure why should I seek a sign off from different Mr\u2019s. or Dr. @ Medanta. Finally Mr. Chandra walked in with his team @ 10AM and recommended that they will be going for angioplasty, to which I declined. Mr. Chandra shared that its our choice though May would be late as I had shared, that if need be we will have it in May. My question was if May was late, why wasn\u2019t the procedure done the previous evening when angiography was done to which I dint get a reply. I was told that direction was to just to Angio.\n\nWhen I said no, the Dr. started walking out though the fellow Dr. suggested that we should recommend medication to which Mr.Chandra said .yeah go ahead. Fellow Dr. prescribed some medicine but when I shared that few medicine are not allowed for my mother, he shared that these are standard advocation and its on our choice \u2026I said.what the crap!\n\nFinally the discharge request was sent to the billing @ 12:30 and here we were for another chaos where the team had no clue on if the approval was there or where is it stuck but finally\u2026\u2026. I mAnasultanged to get the aishwaryasingh23ment sorted by 3:40 PM and I am back on the floor where my mother was waiting in discharge lounge for clearance and reports.\n\nA gentlemen came where he intended to bring all the reports together with medicine but to my surprise, angiography reports was missing. When we asked that this was the only reason we had come here, we were told that probably its at the Dr. Desk. By that time we were frustrated but I thought to go down and settle the access card cash and guess what when my mother came back with the attendant with reports- it just had printed copy with no X-Ray and CD of the report.\n\nSo.To Medanta\u2026This is what you did claiming. That you are Dedicated to Life\u2026. I would say\u2026. STOP PLAYING AROUND!"

We still remember how treatment was done in a reputed hospital.The hospital is completely commercial and patients are just minting machine for them. They have no humanity. Lack of communication is a big problem from nurses and doctors .No care and inefficient staff.\n\nPatient went to hospital for ICD/Pacemaker implant which is a simple   procedure.Due to doctors inefficiency and careless attitude I lost my father after staying in hospital  for 15 days  which costed me 16 Lakh rupees.(11 lakh for ICD which is of no use now)\n\nI had send them mail/talked to  their feedback cell but didn't got any answers for below queries.\n\nFollowing questions were asked:\n\nMy questions:\n\n1) There are discrepancies in death summary report. As per report'Patient was admitted in with severe chest paint' .This is not true, patient was not having any chest pain he was admitted in stable condition in a room. He was admitted to place ICD and we were told that he will be discharged after 3 days. Why wrong information has been written in summary report.\n\n2) Dr. X(Who implanted ICD) went on leave for a week after ICD implantation. We were told patient will be taken care by Dr. Y(Surgeon) and there was no backup for Dr. X .\n\n3) Third day after operation, due to medication, patient\u2019s had lot of stomach ache and loose motion. This led to patient\u2019s health deterioration . His other parameters also went down and he went into serious condition. We feel negligence in this situation further led to patient\u2019s death.\n\n3) Patient was in HDU and had asked for water; he was given water after half an hour.\n\n4) Communication from Nurses, resident doctors was very weak. They hardly had any information and for every question they used to tell us to ask Dr.Y who was very difficult to reach.\n\n5) During whole process it looked that no doctor was in command, always got conflicting statements. It looked like they had made up their mind that patient is seriously ill and has to go and they had no answer .It seems trainee doctors have been put in ICU.\n\n6) It was told by doctor on 19/10/2016 that ICD will take 2-3 months to work. If that was the case then why was it not communicated to us initially? Why it didn't work?\n\n7) What was the reason that a critical patient was shifted from ICU 4 to ICU 5? We got conflicting statements for this question. Just because new patient had come he was shifted that time patient was on ventilator and balloon. We saw lot of carelessness in handling from staff at that time\n\n8) The day patient expired, why there was no incharge doctors(Cardiologist/Senior doctors) present at that time when patient was critically ill\n\n9) We were never counseled by doctor what was the cause of death? It was said due to low blood pressure. Won't  recommend this hospital."

My mother had Arrhythmia Attack(Improper beating of the heart, whether irregular, too fast or too slow) she was immediately hospitalized at the local Hospital. However Our local Doctors recommended for atrial fibrillation is called \"maze\" surgery. In this operation, the surgeon makes small cuts or burns in the atria that prevent the spread of disorganized electrical signals. So here we were, From the start the Doctor who is supposed to be this disease Expert consultation did not guide and clarified and simply said tomorrow is your operation. With no clue and trust on the doctor we went ahead and prepaid and got the admission formalities done on the same day to be admitted the next day considering the queue and time consuming activities at Medanta. On getting admitted the other morning we were allotted single room The operation was scheduled at 4.30 pm My mother was taken near the OPD and she was waiting at the lounge for 3 hours finally the operation started around 8-8.15 pm. We were not given any clue or clarity or any kind of counselling how severe the operation would be wch my mother and Us were not mentally prepared. The operation was traumatic more coz of lack of proper counselling. Also, the attendant was asked to vacate the room and wait at some waiting lounge despite taking the room. From start to end no clarity n process were explained all the time we kept wondering what will be next. Also to get her discharged we waited for 7 hours as the doctor was not responsible enough to visit even once and discuss how is my mother feeling. It was such an unorganized and struggling experience while we were wandering from one counter to another(Considering How well spread Medanta is in 43 acres) to get the processing done.\n\nOverall we witnessed so much miscommunication and mismanagement and above all the kind of attention required from the doctor to patient was missing. Will never recommend this hospital to anyone"

Moreover, on the off chance that you are as of now are conceded [ and in this manner vulnerable to move] then be prepared to give a lot of money to the healing facility. However, regardless of how much cash they make, they will guarantee that each time a patient's relatives or family come to visit, not just do they get unreasonably charged for stopping [ yes a healing center that charges for stopping - as though individuals go come here for a Picnic! ], and on top of it guests get pestered by rude'gate attendants'. In the event that you go to managers for any help, its like conversing with a divider - they gaze directly through you, including senior heads, some of whom are \"Specialists\" yet don't have any sympathy or sound judgment understanding in them.

Finally we zeroed in on Medanta, keeping in mind the positive reviews that we'd heard about the hospital in the field of robotic surgery, especially robotic nephrectomy.\n\nDr. Rajiv Yadav explained to us the treatment option and told us that in view of clinically localised renal mass, partial nephrectomy was preferred. We were relieved after this consultation with Dr. Yadav because a majority of doctors in Guwahati had suggested radical nephrectomy.\n\nMy father was admitted under Dr. Rajiv Yadav on 5/10/16 at Medanta. We were given a comprehensive overview of the surgery, the possible benefits and complications of the process of admission, the duration of stay, the procedure itself and likely outcomes and complications.\n\nLeft Robotic Partial Nephrectomy was done on 6/10/16 under GA by Dr. Yadav.

He was discharged on the morning of 10/10/16 and we stayed in Delhi for two more days before returning to Guwahati on the 14th of October, 2016.\n\nRobotic nephrectomy is something that we did not have much idea about, and we were almost ready for an open/laparoscopic surgery as advised by most doctors in our hometown.

He was diagnosed of Dieulafoy lesion, a rare illness of which there is no documented treatment but only immediate first aid. We are natives of the hills and it takes a person six hours to reach Delhi. The only person to be given credits of having my father all hail and hearty today is Dr. Rajesh Puri. Having been treated by him before as well, Dr. Puri left no stone unturned to have my dad being brought to Medanta as early as possible. The most relevant fact is that he did not wait for the patient to arrive to the hospital as he knew it would be too late by then, Dr. Puri made sure from miles away that the patient is been given the right amount of first aid during the journey by constantly directing the attendant, attending my dad. This as a matter of fact, became the most important factor of life saving treatment of my dad. My recommendation is, that one should always call the doctor/ hospital before hand(even if one\u2019s place is half an hour away from the hospital) to start with the process of first aid as soon as possible, as in my dad\u2019s case we realized that the telephonic vigilance by the doctor throughout the way saved his life. After the patient's arrival Dr. Rajesh Puri only focused on how he would start the treatment, his priority became the life of my father and not his position, as a doctor. We witnessed him rushing to the blood bank himself and bringing bottles of blood as he didn\u2019t want to waste a single minute of the patient\u2019s life. That was the dedication this doctor possessed. Whatever I am expressing is nothing compared to what Dr. Puri has done for my dad and our family. Not any amount of thank you would be enough to him and his service. Further I would not hesitate to thank deeply Dr. Naresh Trehan, Dr. Sunil Mishra, Dr. Sheilly Kapoor and Dr. Rajneesh Kapoor for their constant support and the manner they treated my father.\n\nI would like to thank the administration of the hospital. They were always prompt and vigilant in their approach. The nursing staff took immense care of my father. Even when he was being treated in the ICU for two days, the staff was always by his side as a family. That dedication and diligence helped my dad recover sooner and also helped us stay stress free during his recovery. The mess incharge Mr. Ravindra Chauhan and his team not only took proper care of the patient's meal but also catered nicely to the attendant\u2019s diet.\n\nAll in all Medanta, Medicity gave us a homely environment and helped us take back healthy memories.

I am sorry to inform you that this has been a very painful and alarming experience for me. I am a specialist at a NABH and a JCI accredited hospital; which makes me well aware of the protocols and procedures.\n\nFor starters; the entire situation was very emotional for the patient and the family;  but being educated and in the medical field; we accepted it and went ahead with the angiography. We were promised the best cardiologist for the procedure which was very kind of our admitting ctvs consultant. As you know an angiography is an awake procedure; my father was alert and aware the entire time. I dont know why a femoral approach was done instead of a radial inspite of a big bounding pulse.\n\nA junior trainee was given the procedure unsupervised! It doesnt matter to me how many angios he has done in his life; but a complication post CABG should have been done by a senior consultant.How can you let a trainee do a procedure unsupervised? The trainee gave it multiple attempts, voicing his disgust and joking with the nurses; causing severe pain to my father. My father had soo much pain that he went into bradycardia(I will specifically mention the heart rate-32!). This was followed by a frantic call by the trainee to the senior consultant who came in and did the procedure. Also to add that trainee admitting out loudly that he hasn't studied the procedure; \"maine ye padha nahi\". I am flabbergasted and outraged! .This was the last thing I would have expected from a brand that'Medanta medicity' is. Right now my dad is having decreased vision in the right eye and there is no ophthalmologist to examine him. I wish I had a chance to treat them at my center and show them how things should be done. The nursing and transport team are very courteous. I am seriously considering legal options.

Well the only answer is\u2026 you can place your trust in God, but not in Medanta. And why do I think so? I lost my mother due to the sheer negligence and the casual approach of the surgery team and the nursing staff of the hospital.\n\nPlease don\u2019t think in any way that I am posting this because of sheer frustration and anger. No! I am posting this, so that the loss and grief our family is going through, others don\u2019t go through and be extremely cautious, if ever you plan to visit Medanta for any treatment.\n\nHere are the facts, which am sure will be enough to enlighten everyone and have a different perspective towards Medanta now~\n\n\u2014 My mother had to undergo a Mitral Valve Replacement Surgery at Medanta, post consultation with the Doctors there. Now valve replacement surgeries nowadays are as common as getting a surgery done for cataract. And this was not an unplanned surgery. We had planned, consulted for 6 months, before getting her operated.\n\nShocking fact number #1\n\nWe got her admitted on 6th Feb 2016 in the hospital. Admission process done, payments made. After two days, we receive a phone call from the finance team that we need to deposit another 4 lac immediately. They tried to create a situation of panic for us\u2026 Panicked, we scrambled to arrange for money. However, upon enquiring as to why the additional money is required, we were told that she needs to undergo CBAG process, which means, that not will she is to undergo an open heart surgery, but a ByPass as well. After much confrontation with the team of doctor\u2019s from the Cardiology department and subsequent investigation it turns out that IT WAS A TYPO ERROR FROM THE NURSING STAFF! Because of a B the nursing staff added instead of writing CAG, a procedure for BYPASS was also added worth another 4 lac! To a layman, who wouldn\u2019t understand, the person would have ended up getting a ByPass done too for no reason at all.\n\nShocking fact number #2\n\nMedanta is like a proper corporate set-up. The hospital manages to lure in patients from across India, basis of the brand image it carries. And why not, afterall, Dr.Naresh Trehan is considered one of the most renowned heart surgeons in India. Anyone usually going for a heart related operative procedure is admitted under the name of Dr. Chandra. Fact? We never ever saw or met Dr. Trehan. Whenever, we asked from floor doctors, if he will be there during surgery, if he would be overseeing the operation, we would get to hear a confident lie from the staff that of course he will be there. In fact, we didn\u2019t even see his second-in-command team of surgeons. We always got to meet a different doctor and mostly a junior doctor. And it is usually these junior doctors who are performing the surgery. Bunch of amateurs have a free reign to practice their skills, clear their doubts and gain experience at the cost of life of a loved one. We never got to know, who performed the surgery on my mom.\n\nShocking fact number #3 and the most important one\n\nPost-surgery, the doctors perform a series of tests to ascertain that the valve and the heart is working properly and the patient can be discharged. After my mom came back home from the hospital after spending 2 weeks, she was recuperating well for 1 month~ of course the pain, the frustration is always there\u2026 you cant move much, you have to sleep straight for atleast 1.5 months. But my mom took all of these in her stride with the only motive of getting better soon.\n\nBut this was not to be. Just after a month, she started complaining of breathlessness and other symptoms, which she had before she was operated. We took her to the hospital, and after a thorough check-up it was revealed that the Mechanical valve which was fitted, was not working. A blood clot had formed, and can be possibly treated using a process known as Thrombolysis. We agreed to it, despite knowing the risks involved. My mom was immediately put on a ventilator and the process was started. The first day we saw some positive results and thought that this may work. However, by the second day her health started failing.\n\nThe doctors refused to take her in for surgery, saying that she is in no condition to be operated upon and it is all wait and watch.\n\nBy the third day, doctors told us that your patient is critically sick, so we can\u2019t do anything. We will probably give it another shot and see if her condition improves. And this is what was shocking\u2026\n\nWhen we had gone to see her around 2 pm, her hands and feet were cold and we told the doctors as well. but they dismissed this by saying that her pulse is dropping so we need to give another try. Later on my father, who is a Doctor himself, told us that her pupils were dilated already and it was just the ventilator which was providing the support.\n\nThis means\u2026 that the doctors at Medanta are so money crazed, that knowing that nothing can be done to save her, knowing that she is clinically dead, they still went ahead and administered the clot busting drug(Thrombolysis) worth 1LAC into her!\n\nThis is how low the doctors at Medanta can go to make money, to meet their targets.\n\nYes, you heard it correctly. For the uninitiated, doctors at Medanta are given targets that they have to convert 60% of their visiting patients into \u2018in patients\u201d Do whatever it takes, scare the people, who will get scared and do as the doctors at Medanta would say.\n\nI urge all my friends, family and colleagues to please spread this message and share with as many people as you can and I only hope that you don\u2019t have to write something like this!?#?PleaseShareAndSaveLife?

All his life he has done unnecessary surgeries of patients.Especially for heart he has done numbers of unnecessary by-pass surgeries to make money. He has done surgeries even on completely normal arteries by giving wrong medical advices to patients for his own good. And Poor patients and there families think he is a god and get ready for treatment suggested by this A$h**e.\n\nThe lines written above are not my instant reaction or frustration but an outcome of my research and views after visiting number of other Doctors(whom I visited for 2nd opinion in my case), friends, office college and relatives(other victims of Medanata hospital) and few other people who I met in the hospital only(victims like me) during my stressful stay of 15 days post-surgery of my loved one.During my visit to one of a very senior cardiologist of a very famous hospital of NCR, I came to know that he had collected CDs of patients who have been unnecessarily operated(open heart bypass surgeries) by Mr Trehan and there is a huge list of such patients.Majority of these patients would have recovered with just medications only, if they have consulted another cardiologist.\n\nAnother partner in crime and a Super Duper Intelligent person is MR R.R Kasliwal, who act, think and talk like a cardiologist but in actual he is no more than a technician. If you don\u2019t believe me then go to him and try to ask few genuine questions and look his reactions/answers and you will know by yourself.Kasliwall is famous in medanta for Angiography but I hardly believe he knows how to do Angiography because the reports he share with me was incomplete(may be it was intentionally) which I got to know after showing it to another doctors.\n\nAlso the figures mentioned in the reports were inflated to scare the patient, he hide lot of good details who could have given me a hint to avoid the unnecessary operation of my loved one. they make some changes in report and inflated the details so that if you have gone to another hospital for 2nd opinion, the doctor will say the say by looking at the reports.These kind of doctors act like pimp to hospitals and can fell down to lowest possible level of humanity just to achieve their monthly business targets by playing with the lives of your loved ones.Not sure why Goverment is keeping a blind eye towards such scandanls else the **person like Trehan and Kasliwal should be in Jail**.

During consultation we were made so scared that we agreed for immediate surgery . When we got her admitted the package was told 4.26 lak and we were asked to clear full bill before surgery as soon we cleared the package amount they operated my mother.\n\nThe surgery was done by the so called king surgeon N.Trehan . He claimed the surgeory was a success but till 3 days she was not shifted from icu 2 and an artificial pace maker was attached to her . When we enquired that if everything is ok why are they not shifting her to icu1 they got scared by our questions and shifted her to icu1 on the 4th day  after surgery . The scene in icu1 was pathetic there was only 1 nurse for so many patients . The doctors claimed they will shift her to room the next day but to our 5th day after surgery they called us and told that she had a cardiac arrest and we should inform our relatives. They also claimed that due to cardiac arrest there is a clot in her brain and 50% of the brain is dead and was put on ventellator, pace maker and balloon support. She struggled for her life and 11th day she had 2 more strokes and early morning before opd starts they declared her dead.\n\nMy only question to this butcher shop is my mom was only 59 with no chalestrol problem no diabeties no bp problem no blockage then how come she had heart attack after successful surgery . And if her heart was that weak then why the hell did you operate.\n\nMr Trehan pls b true to your profession we know you have started up a business and need payback but not on cost of someones life SHAME on you and Your family who supports you in this.\n\nI m posting this because what we lost will never come back to us but others please save your loved ones\n\nMedanta is not a hospital but it is a business house . They have contacts with dr's in other cities who refer patients to medanta and get a handsome commission of the total bill. And the management here will call u now and then to clear the bills on daily basis\n\nThese people changed all her reports at the time of disharging the body .

He was further recommended for Angiography in which two arteries were found to be blocked by 100% and one by 90%. A bypass surgery was to be done.\n\nWe took him to Medanta Hospital Gurgaon, thinking that it was the best in the country. Doctor performed PET scan after 2 days of admission and concluded that only 15% muscles were dead and rest could be regenerated post the bypass.\n\nOn 24th Nov 2015 they took my father in law for bypass in the morning at 8am. The operation as told was supposed to take max 6hours. It was Dr Trehan who was supervising his team of doctors in the operation theater. After an hour, they called me and said that my father in law's heart valve also needs to be repaired which was a dynamic decision and we were asked to deposit value surgery charges and ring charges. Previously we were told that valve leakage was not major and could be cured by medicines. They continued the surgery till 4:00 pm and we were not given any status even post 6 hours'max' window. Our nervousness was increasing with every minute and we tried contacting many other doctors including Dr Rajneesh to know the status.\n\nFinally, at 4:00pm Dr. said that the operation was done but the heart was not reviving and the patient was critical. They shifted my father in law to an ICU on ventilator support.\n\nNext day, in the morning they told us another operation needs to be performed since there was bleeding and blockage. They operated for 2-3 hours and told that my father in law was still critical. This operation as was told to us was performed under Dr Trehan.\n\nOn the same day, 25th we stood for 3 hours outside Trehan's cabin to meet him. Finally he met and told that the heart was found to be weak when it was opened and the patient was critical. We were surprised to hear as PET scan report said differently.\n\nMy father in law was only 57, non diabetic, non smoker, non alcoholic. They put him on dialysis on 25th evening.\n\nNext day there was no sign of improvement when we went to meet him. He was on ventilator and pace maker. Hard to say whether he was alive but his body started turning blue. When hospital was closed for OPD and there was less crowd they called us as 9.30 pm and said that my father in law's heart collapsed and declared him dead after an hour.\n\nSome open questions, was bleeding occurred due to doctors' mistake during the first operation? Why we were not told about the risk? Was value repair a strategy to get some more money? When you do not have time to visit patient's relatives outside your cabin, were you serious enough while operating? Is it only the name and fame that has created trust in Medanta, the Medicity and Dr. Trehan?\n\nLife could be a play for you but ask someone who has lost everything!"

My back right teeth were hurting and some skin is coming in between the teeth which bleeds while brushing and is otherwise painful to chew.\n\nAfter specifically telling her about my medical history and how my wisdom tooth has not been extracted I was told to get an x-ray done before further recomendation.

She recommended I eat augmentin(which is a antibiotic) and somer medicine for the pain and if that does not help she will remove the last tooth. How does removing a healthy tooth solve the problem of some skin coming between my back teeth? And how will that solve my wisdom tooth from coming out right? She has not even seen an x-ray from the side to check if the problem can be resolved without removing someone healthy tooth.\n\nAn ENT doctor had recommended I visit a dentist and they can remove the skin coming from the back teeth but she had no time to listen or even explain what she prescribed to me.\n\nWhen I asked what if the medicine doesnt help she told me she will remove the teeth!\n\nI forgot to mention that she had changed her room in between telling me to get my xray done  while in room 31 to room 19 and was having tea with a colleague while I stood there the whole time and left with a prescription!

The doctors take time to explain the treatment clearly and always listen patiently to every concern.

During my wifes LACS, Dr. Archana (anesthetist) kept struggling for 2030 mins with multiple attempts before another doctor fixed it in 2 mins, leaving my wife in pain for days. Our newborn was kept in NICU for ~8 days only to develop rashes, torn skin & bleeding due to careless nursing. Doctors contradicted each other on discharge just to inflate bills. Nursing staff ignored repeated calls for basic help, and housekeeping was pathetic. Even after complaints to Guest Relations (Mrs. Pooja), improvements lasted only a day. Discharge was full of harassment, valet parking staff was missing, and the food court served stale, overpriced foodeven an expired coconut water pack to my wife. This hospital is a profit-making trap with zero care for patients."

Our experience with the treatment given to my father is totally below the level of medical professionalism. There is total lack of communication with the family members by the staff and the doctors in the MICU.\n\nThey order all sort of tests repeatedly and the diagnosis is never revealed. There is never a plan explained by any of the doctors to the family, which is totally unacceptable. All they say to the inquiry by the concerned family is it is in God's hands. They do tests, the diagnosis is never justified, then they order more tests, and continue to keep the family in the dark. They deliberately make delays, which is party of policy without any explanation and continue to rack the bills. The expenses incurred by the family and the suffering of the patient is not in play. So many unnecessary infections were acquired by my father in thev MICU due to the unhygienic practice s. All the doctors have to is hospital acquired infection that cannot be helped.\n\nDuring the 8-week stay we wanted to move my father out of the Max care, but we were given false promises and sweet talk. I have written a letter to the chairman, yesterday and I really hope he responds. If not well you all know about karma, we go way back, we have become very close friends."

Without any test results, the doctor claimed that I might have dengue and insisted on admitting me to the emergency department until the reports were available. I was told that if the dengue test was negative, I would be discharged within 24 hours. However, I was admitted without an attendant, and the reports, which were ready by 11 PM on 9th August, were not communicated to me promptly.\n\nFrom the beginning, I was very clear that I could not afford a large medical bill as I am a student, and my family is not in town. I have corporate insurance, but I was informed that I could not claim it due to not completing six months at my company. Despite this, I was not informed about my insurance status until 10th August.\n\nDuring my stay, I was not updated about my diagnosis or treatment. On 10th August, around 10 PM, I requested to be discharged as I was feeling fine and was concerned about incurring unnecessary charges. However, the hospital staff was uncooperative, and I felt that I was being billed without receiving proper treatment or information.\n\nUpon discharge, the nursing and billing staff were unsupportive. As a patient on IVs, I had to navigate the hospital alone, which I found to be highly irresponsible and unprofessional behavior.\n\nI am seeking assistance on how to file a grievance and claim compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused by this experience. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMARYAM HUSSAIN"

If any patient wants to go to the toilet, they have to wait 15-20 mins for the nurse to come and help the patient. They weren't changing the bedsheets of their patients even for weeks and we had to request them to change the clothes of our patients.\n\nDue to their negligence, I lost my father. The doctor named Vaibhav Chachra is worse as he doesn't know how to take care of the patients and even how to deal with the family. He was only looking to make money for his hospital and I am sure that he was having his cut in all these. We have spent lakhs of rupeeson the treatment and still, I lost my father. Every day was a trauma for us as Vaibhav was scary every day and every time. Doctor like him needs to learn how to take care of the patients and their families while in treatment and I would suggest he go to a mental hospital.\n\nDoctors and hospitals like him bring a bad reputation, not only to the Uttrakhandbut also to the whole country. So please avoid the hospital and doctors and in the worst case if you have to visit then make sure to take the patient to the other good hospital as soon as possible."

        "review": "I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a distressing incident that occurred during my father's recent admission to your hospital on April 23rd, 2024. My father, Mr. Prakash Koundal, is a heart patient, and we entrusted his care to your esteemed institution.\n\nOn April 24th, 2024, my father underwent a test prescribed by his doctor, accompanied by my mother. Unfortunately, during their visit, my mother, who is not well-educated, approached Dr. Neha Chaudhary on the floor with concerns about the hygiene of the instruments being used. Dr. Neha's response was shockingly unprofessional and utterly unacceptable. She not only yelled at my mother in an aggressive manner but also humiliated her in front of other patients present in the area. Furthermore, she escalated the situation by calling security and forcibly ejecting my mother from the room.\n\nTo compound the distress, upon my father's return from the test, he also faced Dr. Neha's inappropriate behavior. Instead of receiving a courteous response, my father was met with further disrespect and aggression. Dr. Neha's conduct towards my elderly parents was not only unprofessional but also deeply upsetting.As per the reports she behaves in the same way with others as well.\n\nDespite our efforts to address the issue with your staff, including raising our concerns with the query desk, the response has been unsatisfactory. While Ms. Nidhi and other senior staff acknowledged the seriousness of the matter, they informed us that Dr. Neha's behavior is considered to be her personality, and therefore, no further action would be taken beyond an apology. As a daughter of Mr parkash koudal i assisted them we just need small sorry from neha to my parents so that they will get out from that feeling not in front of everyone but in person to my parent i didn't ask for the bigger thing but nidhi along with sr dr tried to defend her and said we are saying sorry on behalf of her this is not justice to my parents .\n\nThis response is wholly inadequate and fails to address the severity of the situation. It is not a matter of mere inconvenience but one of harassment and mistreatment of patients under your care. My parents, as well as our family, feel deeply distressed by this experience.\n\nI implore you to take immediate and decisive action to address this matter. It is imperative that Dr. Neha Chaudhary be held accountable for her unprofessional conduct and that steps are taken to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future. My parents, along with other patients, deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, and compassion."

Not knowing when the doctor would return I went back to billing and asked for change of doctor who is available. Billing executive asked to find out which doctor is available.\n\nSo, I went back to Urology reception and\n\nasked for alternately available doctor. The receptionist told me that the doctor would be coming soon, so I waited Dr Dassi to return.\n\nDr Dassi returned after sometime and called me to his office out of turn. He asked me not to sit in chair and keep standing.\n\nHe raised his voice angrily talking in a most rash and rude manner as to why I can't wait. His demeanour was that of a school teacher trying to punish his students.\n\nI suggest that a video camera should be installed in Dr Dassi's cabin to record such incidents since he saw me alone.\n\nI intend to take up the matter with Directors / Chairman of Max group of hospitals and also Medical Council of India or similar bodies.

She presents herself as knowledgeable, but in reality, she turned out to be someone ready to take advantage of vulnerability, making her more of a scam artist than a professional. Punctuality was a consistent issue as she was frequently late for sessions without any prior notice, leading to prolonged delays.\n\nIn addition to her lack of professionalism, she exhibited manipulative behavior that negatively influenced my perspective on the world. Her approach involved more threats than guidance, creating an unhealthy environment for communication. Furthermore, she displayed judgmental tendencies, making it difficult for me to open up during sessions.\n\nRather than providing coping mechanisms for anxiety, her sessions exacerbated my condition, prompting me to seek help from another mental health professional. Overall, my experience with her was detrimental, and I am still in the process of recovering from the negative impact of our interactions. In light of my experience, I cannot recommend her as a trustworthy or right-minded therapist.\n\nI feel compelled to caution individuals against seeking therapy from Ann Simi John, as my personal experience suggests it may not be a valuable investment of time and money.\n\nThe video posted above reveals instances of her tardiness during live meetings, which raises concerns about her overall integrity."

Dr. MANNU BATHIA was my mother's surgeon in 2019. He had the challenge of redoing her back surgery which was a reparation for a bad surgery done in 2019 in Cameroon. The surgery was successful.\n\nToday I'm here again to share another special journey with him and his team. 5 years later after my mom's surgery on her back, she trusted Dr. Mannu again and came here for surgery on her knees. At first, she was scared because many hospital policies around the world allow only surgery on one knee at a time. Dr Mannu as usual knew how to comfort her and explained that it would be possible to have both done on the same day. Her second concern was the rehabilitation length of time. Most of the literature we have read confirms that the effective walking process can come after 3 to 6 months. Coming from Africa to a foreign country to stay for an undetermined period can be challenging regarding financial expenses. Dr Mannu one more time comfort her saying that a month of recovery will be enough to stand up and go back to her country safe and on her feet. The surgery on her knees(both) was successfully done on November 14, 2023. There were no complications before during or after the surgery. The hospital team was able to help her stand with a walker 3 days later. Today(November 29), she is at her guest house moving by herself, dancing some mornings, and appreciating her \"18-year-old brand new knees\".\n\nThe hospital was so organized, and clean, following all the standard protocols. The staff was dedicated. The price of the surgery was affordable. Dr. Mannu was friendly, hearted, and highly skilled. A special kudo to Mr. Parvaiz who is Dr Mannu's right hand. He went above and beyond with my mother's care from the beginning to the end. I especially recommend Dr. Mannu from Max Hospital to anyone who wants to transform his medical care in India into a wonderful journey filled with Love, care, expertise, and reliability.\n\nDr Mannu, you are devoted and specialized in what you doing, and what makes the difference is your heart full of compassion and sympathy. My family and I will never forget the impact that you had on my mum's life. You are a precious piece in the extension of her life expectancy. May God bless you and your family indefinitely. You know how to bring back alive any dead bones. As a medical provider, I know what I am talking about and I feel blessed to have such a devoted provider in the medical practice. You did a great job as always. Thank you so much for everything.\n\nDiane Boyom"

To discuss these concerns I was introduced to THE GREAT LALITESH SANGWAN, on mentioning that I also come from an hospitality background he called my ex company VANA to enquire about me, he is such a unprofessional, especially discussing me over coffee with someone from your previous workplace, is completely unacceptable. It's fortunate that Sandeep, the Vice President, extended an apology, but the lack of accountability from Dr. Lalitesh Sangwan is concerning. Max Hospital indeed needs to reconsider their leadership selection and prioritise patient care and professionalism. I am curious about Sangwan's inquiries to Vana, warranting a comprehensive explanation and accountability from the hospital's management.\n\nI need to hear from you soon owner of max hospital and have all the proofs (videos, audio\u2019s and pictures) for whatsoever I said in this review.\n\nThanks, looking forward to hear from you asap"

So, we decided to visit Max Hospital, Mohali, which is identified as a great chain in the medical sector, and it is 250km away from our hometown. On 30th October, we paid opd to meet Dr. Manish Singla. To our surprise, he didn't do anything, just referred to chest specialist Dr. Deepak Bhasin. To meet him, we again paid the opd charges. Ironically, instead of doing the process of pleural effusion removal, the doctor took just a sample of fluid by painful injection and prescribed some tests worth Rs. 12000, which turns out to be all negative. These 3 days until we got reports were just waiting period in pain without getting any treatment or prescription\n\nOn 2nd November, after getting the reports, when we visited again there. We faced harassment as we had to wait for 2 and half hours, which is like one has to do in any government hospital. Honestly, this is a black spot on the brand image of Max Hospital. After waiting a long. We paid other opd charges, and upon our request, they did the process of pleural effusion removal. It cost 6100 for the process coupled with 2200 for consumables.\n\nDespite paying a lot of money and investing long time. The doctors were supposed to prescribe some post process consequences like fever or so. But they didn't tell anything even if they didn't give any antibiotics to cure the effects.\n\nLast night, my father was suffering from severe fever, and we were not aware of what to do. This morning, when I approached the assigned doctors, they didn't pick up the call and messaged back to call at 3 p.m., which is really an unpleasant experience. At the given time when we contacted. His attendent told me that the doctor would call you back. Till 5 pm, we didn't receive any call. Such negligence can lead to severe problems. On being enquired, these problems are usual here."

It was around 5 pm when I had gone for lab draw and before filling out the registration form, I confirmed with the front desk that if it's possible to get the reports same day as I had to see my private doctor next day at 9:30 am. She confirmed that physical report is not possible but I would get the report in my email by end of the day and I can use it for my doctor's appointment.\n\nI again confirmed with the guy who drew the blood and was given the same assurance that although physical report is not possible, I would get the details in my email that same day.\n\nNever received the email that day. Waited till 9:30 am next day, no email. Tried calling, no answer. By this time, had to cancel doctor's appointment and couldn't reschedule because I had to fly back next day.\n\nI finally went to Max requesting a refund which was denied by front desk and referred to the Manager on Duty, Prakash Kumar Singh. The most arrogant, disgusting and disrespectful guy I have ever met. Instead of listening and trying to understand, he accused me with \"how do we believe you didn't get the email\". I offered to show my inbox and his response \"well you could have deleted it\". I offered to share my Deleted folder and his final accusation that so deleted the email from the Deleted folder!!\n\nOn top of that, he looked at the doctor's order and gave his so-called diagnosis that I am creating a fuss as the tests do not show I have any chronic issue so I shouldn't worry that much!! I asked him is he a medical professional to diagnose and he used his experience working in medical field. He then called his supervisor Mr Ajay Kumar who was very understanding and talked in a much calmer tone but Mr Prakash would override whatever his supervisor would say.\n\nNothing got resolved with all this chaos!! They kept saying I can have my reports and my argument was these reports are no good to me as it was not delivered in timely manner as promised by Max personnels. They reached out to GM Mr Sachin Srinivasan who agreed to give 25% refund which I was not ready to accept. Mr Arun Kumar assured me he will work on the issue on Monday and would update me but no phone call or email from him. I called him on Monday and was told to give him 24 hrs which again was useless as he didn't pick the phone after that.\n\nI have the proof of the employee who registered me on the receipt and the signature of the person who drew my blood. I told them to contact both employees and confirm I am telling the truth but they didn't care to double check the facts.\n\nOverall, it was a headache to deal with this much of unprofessionalism and disrespect of Mr Prakash and Max as a whole entity. I know they will still get patients and clients everyday but I will make sure to share my experience with all my friends in US and also ensure they avoid this facility.\n\nShame on the administration to not consider a request for Rs 2100 and shame on having employees like Mr Prakash who lacks basic courtesy and customer service skills."

The hospital's inefficiency and lack of accountability led to a highly unsatisfactory experience, lasting for five months and counting. I urge anyone considering this hospital to be cautious and explore other options."

Overall, I received a satisfactory care from competent and dedicated doctors and other Hospital staff. However, I had a very bad experience with Dental Department. On March 25, I underwent a full-mouth laser gingival curettage and received a crown-and-bridge placement which involved exorbitant charges of INR86, 859(over USD1, 000), plus INR9, 567 for a root canal. Upon returning to Tanzania, on April 14 I noticed the crowns beginning to chip, and within a week they had completely detached. When I reported this to the Dental Department, I was offered a complimentary replacement bridge but this would involve local dentist consultation in Tanzania, digital impressions, bite registration, and subsequent refitting at my own cost. I declined the offer, not only due to the expense but also because of my concerns about the crowns quality and the risks of coordinating two different dentists across countries. Instead, I requested a full refund of my total treatment cost(INR96, 426).\n\nSince no agreement was reached, I escalated the matter to the International Patients Department. I received a notification stating that an International Patients Representative would contact me. However, I have not heard from anyone. The only communication I have received were internal email exchanges, on which I was merely copied.\n\nThis experience has been deeply disappointing, especially considering Apollo Hospitals esteemed reputation in Tanzania and globally. As an international patient, I have placed my trust and my resources in care of this hospital, expecting the best out of it. I hope the hospital addresses this promptly and ensures better support for international patients in similar situations."

They are not using latest medical equipments, they used 18 gauge needle for spinal fluid test which is not latest..didnt use any ultrasound or local anaesthesia..poked my dad 8 times in the spine..couldn't do it right even once and he is highly diabetic and they didn't even care to wipe off the blood after or put a plaster on it..he went through a lot of pain and suffering that he literally asked for poison instead, even when he didn't give consent after 3 pricks, they proceeded without consent and forcefully pricked him 8 times. Dr. Sarmistha Panigrahi (Anaesthesiology) was the one responsible for it. The skill and education of her is really questionable. Very lazy staff even after calling them multiple times, they don't come and attend us even when they are free, they just sit and chat. So careless they don't attend the patient on time and so negligent in giving medicines..they gave dolo instead of diabetic medicine once. Since we are educated enough we could tell the difference..just imagine the harm it can cause to naive people. When the negligence was confronted they didn't even apologize. Too over priced for the services provided. Just another commercial branded hospital. Not patient centric like they market."

And the hospital administration killed him in the name of angiography, Even though I am blaming on Dr Sanjeev team in anger, but the real culprit is me. Doctors profession is such that always see incidents of death in the hospital, someone's death may be a normal thing for them, but what difficulties the death of a person may cause to his family, it may not make any difference to them\n\nToday, I have suffered the biggest loss. My children's education was run from his pension money, because I was unable to maintain the family with my small job. Now, even the children's education will remain incomplete because my main support is gone.\n\nI want answer only these 3 questions from apollo navi mumbai\n\n1.Did I take him to you in a dying condition?\n\n2.If I had not got angioplasty done as per hospital advice, how many days would he have lived?\nCan I get the cctv footage of 13th July 24 from 5 am to 9 pm to know what all happened to him because even the staff of Apollo is not trustworthy.\nDr. Sanjeev is a good doctor but some of his team members were very careless and that became the reason for my father's death.

Hospital had initially taken cashless approval against my corporate ICICI policy, however, when we saw the estimate especially room rate, the hospital has shown room rate as INR 8200 whereas for same room they were charging INR 5000 from individuals as well as some other insurance companies. Since my room limit under corporate policy was less than INR 8200, I decided to use my personal Star health policy and asked hospital to get the cashless authorisation against Star Health policy which we got within 2 hours. After getting the approval I had categorically written to hospital of our intention of using Star Health Policy. To our utter surprise the hospital first got the claim realised from Star health on 28th May and submitted another bill to ICICI on 3rd June so that they can claim the amount twice to in tease their profit by fraud. ICICI also paid the claimed amount to Apollo. When I checked with Apollo, they just said that it is a human error.\n\nFrom this it is clear that hospital is trying all unfair means to make money as they had knowingly submitted another claim to ICICI which shows fraudulent practices being followed by Apollo and puts a question mark on their so called ethical practices.\n\nIn my openion one should only go to Apollo if they have someone known working in hospital"

Surgery went well but the doctor who suggested surgery \" Dr Bharat Kumar\" is pathetic without medical ethics. Based on Liver biopsy he tells my sister \" Your life is OVER. You will have to spend rest of your life on steroids which will cause other health concerns\". But since the serology report was negative about AUTO Immune Disorder. He told her to consult Liver Transplant Specialist of Apollo for second opinion. My sister couldnt sleep for a week. After a week we decided to take her to another Doctor from Global Hospital and he was surprised to know the kind of scary language Dr Bharat used. Finally series of tests were redone there . Her Liver block was received from and given to Global Hospital and biopsy ruled out chances of Auto Immune PBC and instead said the duct narrowing was either due to intake of some other medicines or Gall bladder issue. Basically biopsy report of Apollo was wrong and Dr Bharat doesnt know how to talk to patients.

It is with great disappointment that I recount the events, hoping to raise awareness and caution others from falling victim to similar situations.\n\nLast weekend, my aunt faced a medical emergency when a small wire became lodged in her throat during dinner. To seek prompt assistance, we rushed her to Apollo Hospital Navi Mumbai. To our dismay, instead of a quick resolution, the hospital subjected her to a series of unnecessary tests and admitted her to the standard ward overnight.\n\nThe wire was eventually removed the next morning via endoscopy by Dr. Swapnil Gosavi. However, our ordeal did not end there. Despite her improving condition, the hospital insisted on keeping her for further observation in the general ward. When I requested discharge in the evening, they declined, insisting on an additional day's stay.\n\nThe shock came when we were presented with a bill totaling Rs. 1, 93, 000, justifying it as a complicated surgery and a severe level emergency case. When I questioned the billing department, I was redirected to Dr. Swapnil Gosavi, who displayed a dismissive and rude attitude. He insensitively mentioned the disturbance to his sleep, claiming a thankless job and asserting that such costs were expected at a hospital like Apollo.\n\nI confronted Dr. Swapnil with valid concerns, questioning why she was not placed in the ICU if it was a severe emergency and why the procedure took place at morning. Unfortunately, his responses lacked clarity and were overshadowed by a condescending attitude.\n\nIn my attempt to rectify the situation, I approached the billing department, only to be met with conflicting stories. Initially, they claimed no prior communication about a deposit, but later altered their stance, stating that a deposit of Rs. 2, 00, 000 was communicated beforehand without any written and signed estimation.\n\nFeeling cheated and desperate for resolution, I have escalated the matter to the ICMR and consumer forum. I share this experience here not only as a cautionary tale but also to urge everyone to stand against such unethical practices. Let us think beyond money and prioritize ethical medical care over financial gains.\n\n#Apollo #DrSanjayGosavi #ThinkBeyondMoney #PatientRights"

After a few running around I finally came to the right place - the absolutely lack of professionalism , no token system of waiting , no clear sense of timing for tests , doctors just walking in with their patients breaking into the queue . A non Indian elderly patient started shouting finally cos he has been waiting till since 11 am and no one has basic courtesy to attend to him to apologise or give him water . And because he started shouting he was taken when it was actually my turn with not so much as chekcing with me !!! This is pathetic - atleast show basic empathy to people who are patients and do not need additional tests . Hospitals with lesser brands and lesser charges have better facilities and better mannered staff as well as doctors . A particular doctor was just using his rank to get in his patients breaking the queue twice . Everyone\u2019s time is important and everyone is suffering - if \u201c children case \u201c is going to be used to guilt everyone to break queues pls tell that before taking our money - Apollo first makes us pay bill before any such test is administered. I would like to mention technician Surekha was trying her best but the doctor was simply throwing his weight and breaking the queue to get in his patients -some of these ppl need immediate ICU level training .

Unjustifiable\n\nThe TPA raised a query in the discharge summary but I don't see any support coming my way and have lost complete trust on medical fraternity....looks like it is a best option not to visit such star hospitals in today's world"

I found that at Apollo Belapur, solutions to a lot of these concerns were thought through and taken care of. The security was professional enough to stick with hospital rules about ICU visitation, and at the same time empathetic enough to handle all caretakers respectfully. Special call out to Samir Bhilare on this front, and additionally for prompt communication in calling the caretaker when doctors required the medical history of the patient or to update the caretaker about the patient\u2019s progress. Apollo also has a great attendant resting area, complete with perhaps 20 or more beds, each equipped with its own bedside lamp, a pillow and a plug point, as well as clean restrooms and bathrooms.

This is regarding surgical treatment of my husband Gaurav Shrivastava done on 21-Mar-2023 (hospitalization from 20-Mar-2023 to 22-Mar-2023). He had taken treatment for \u201cKidney stone removal\u201d from Apollo Hospital, Belapur Navi Mumbai. As per the initial CT scan test report (dated 20-Mar-2023), 2 stones were present in left kidney which were 7 mm each in size and one in the right kidney of 14mm size.\n\nHe underwent a surgery on 21-Mar-2023. After surgery, the doctors informed that the stones have been removed and in Discharge Summary same was mentioned that stones have been broken by laser lithotripsy and removed from the left Kidney and the stone of the right kidney was powdered and then bilateral DJ stenting was done. He was discharged on 22-Mar-2023 (stents were to be kept for 3-4 weeks). In the medical bill, all these procedures have been charged for both the kidneys.\n\nNow, we contacted another Physician for \u201cRemoval of DJ stents\u201d since the price in Apollo was very high and this new physician suggested to undergo a CT scan (at any diagnostic centre of our choice) before this procedure. As per the CT scan report (dated 10-Apr-2023), it was identified that the stones are still present in both the kidneys (one 7mm stone in left kidney and one 14mm stone in right kidney) and even the size of the stones were also same (size was same as that of the CT scan dated 20-Mar-2023).\n\nThat means the surgical treatment provided by Apollo Hospital was fake and is a case of medical negligence and fraud.\n\nAs per my current Physician recommendation, I will again have to undergo a surgery to remove the stones along with \u201cRemoval of DJ stent\u201d and a new stent will be placed.\n\nThis has affected my husband, me and my family members gravely in all aspects- mentally, physically, and financially. I have paid a huge amount for this treatment around 3 lakhs (3 days hospitalization) and my husband had tolerated so much pain and blood loss (during and after procedure) but the medical issue has not been resolved.\n\nAs Apollo didn\u2019t provide a proper treatment, my husband will again need a surgery for \u201cRemoval of Kidney stones\u201d.\n\nI asked the hospital that, based on my complaint, Apollo management should take action against all the doctors involved in this fake treatment scam and I want refund of all the amount that I have paid along with compensation for the mental and physical trauma that me and my family members have suffered. However, just like their doctors the management is negligent too.\n\nNow, I am going to take a legal action against Apollo Hospital and its responsible medical staff and posting this to warn everyone that this hospital runs scams and frauds in treatment."

The initial plan was to perform an angiogram here and then move him to Narayana Hospital in Bangalore for further treatment.\n\nHowever, what followed was one of the most distressing experiences we've ever had. Despite him walking and speaking normally upon arrival, he was immediately shifted to the ICU. From that point on, things spiraled downward. His regular medications were changed without proper explanation, and we were kept in the dark about critical decisions.\n\nStudent doctors handled his case with minimal supervision, and the senior staff, including the head nurse, were unapproachable and rude. Even the basic courtesy you'd expect from support staff like ICU cleaners was missing.\n\nMost shockingly, without any informed consent from our family, they placed him on an invasive ventilator and conducted X-ray. Within just two days of admission, we tragically lost him.\n\nTo make things worse, the hospital delayed issuing the death report, making us run around for two more days while we were already grieving.\n\nUnless you have influence or strong connections, you might not receive the care and attention you deserve here. For us, it was a heartbreaking and irreparable loss. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone."

        "review": "\"DEADLY NEGLIGENCE AT MEDICA HOSPITALDO NOT TRUST DR. AMLAN MANDAL\"\n\nIt is with deep grief, anguish, and a heavy heart that I write this review. My father, aged 63 years, was admitted to Medica Superspecialty Hospital, Kolkata on 23rd February 2025, under the care of Dr. Amlan Mandal. What we believed would be a short-term observation for a manageable condition turned into a devastating loss, due to sheer medical negligence, arrogance, and lack of empathy.\n\nMy father was generally fit and active for his age. He suddenly fell ill, lost bowel control, and was found to have an old blood clot and a mild reaction to recent medications. Based on this, we rushed him to Medica for emergency admission. After initial tests, the doctors themselves told us that the condition was not as serious as we fearedthe blood clots were old and manageable, and the primary issue was an electrolyte imbalance(sodium-potassium levels). With basic treatment, his condition improved within hourshe was walking, talking, and feeling normal.\n\nDespite his rapid improvement, the medical team insisted on keeping him for just two more days for observation. Our family was inclined to bring him home, but we were convinced to let him stay, thinking it was the safer optiona decision we now deeply regret.\n\nFrom Day 2 onwards, the situation took a mysterious and alarming turn. The doctors began pointing out new symptoms every dayissues with food consumption, oxygen imbalance, discomfort. They inserted a Ryles tube(nasogastric tube) even though my father had no swallowing issues initially. They placed him on oxygen support, and later diagnosed a lung infection that had never existed before his hospital admission. This infection spiraled out of control, and they utterly failed to detect or manage it properly.\n\nThroughout this time, Dr. Amlan Mandal and his team were dismissive, rude, and extremely difficult to communicate with. Every time we asked for clarification or questioned the declining health of our loved one, we were met with condescending responses like, \"Do you understand more than us?\". Dr. Mandal carried himself with an air of superiority, completely ignoring the legitimate concerns of family members who were watching a loved one deteriorate before their eyes.\n\nWhen the Ryles tube was inserted, my father visibly showed discomfort and distressmoving his legs, adjusting his posturesigns which were ignored by the medical staff. And because he was moved to the ICU, we were cut off from monitoring his care closely, unable to intervene or transfer him to another hospital once we realized things were spiraling out of control. We were simply told to wait and trust the processa process that ultimately led to his death.\n\nWhats even more disturbing is what one of the hospital staff told our family driver, who was crying on the day of the passing:\n\nThis hospital is nothing but a business. Its a place of death, not care.\n\nThat one sentence said everything we had felt but couldnt believethat our trust had been horribly misplaced. My father entered this hospital walking and talking, and within 10 days, he was gonenot because of the original condition, but because of the negligence, mishandling, and egotistical approach of Dr. Amlan Mandal and his team.\n\nThis review is not written out of impulseits a warning to families who are considering placing their loved ones under his care. Our biggest mistake was trusting him and this hospital. Please, dont make the same one."

Unfortunately, my son passed away during his treatment, and I feel compelled to share my experience in the hope that it may prevent others from enduring similar hardship.\n\nMy son underwent a stem cell transplant at this hospital, and from the outset, we faced multiple complications, including severe fever, loose motions, and respiratory issues. Despite these complications, the treatment offered was inadequate, and the management of these issues was subpar, with no clear path for resolution.\n\nAdditionally, I found the hospital\u2019s practices, including exorbitant medical charges and an overall lack of proper care, to be deeply concerning. The success rate of stem cell transplants, which I was told was only around 20%, is a significant factor to consider, and I wish I had been made more fully aware of the risks and the likelihood of success before proceeding.\n\nDuring the course of treatment, my son was subjected to high doses of medication and injections, which were not adequately monitored. It seems that the overdose of these medications may have contributed to his condition worsening, leading to his untimely death.\n\nI invested a significant amount of money\u2014over 55 lakhs\u2014hoping to save my child, but in the end, I lost him due to what I believe was both ineffective treatment and lack of proper care.\n\nI strongly urge anyone considering stem cell treatment at Mazundar Shaw Medical Center to think carefully and weigh the risks involved. My family and I were devastated by this experience, and I want to make sure that others are fully informed before making such a critical decision."

After that he referred to Dr Devi shetty. When we met to Dr Devi Shetty, doctor said that it is emergency to replace aortic valve.

The hospital is well-equipped with advanced technology, and the medical team is highly professional and experienced in their respective fields.\n\nFrom the moment you step into the hospital, you are greeted with warmth and compassion. The staff is incredibly supportive, making sure that both patients and their families feel at ease during what can be a very challenging time. The doctors take the time to explain every aspect of the treatment plan, addressing any concerns or doubts with patience.\n\nOne aspect that particularly stood out was the hospital's emphasis on holistic care. They don't just focus on treating the disease but also on the overall well-being of the patient. The availability of counseling services, nutritional support, and various wellness programs is a testament to their commitment to comprehensive care.\n\nThe hospital's infrastructure is modern and clean, ensuring a comfortable environment for recovery. The nursing staff is attentive, and the administration is efficient in handling appointments, billing, and other formalities.\n\nOverall, Dharamshila Cancer Hospital provides a beacon of hope for those battling cancer. Their dedication to providing quality care, combined with their compassionate approach, makes it a place where you feel confident in the treatment you or your loved ones are receiving.\n\n---"

Totally 16000 rupees charged for all tests. additionally charged 4900 rupees for stockings. Where as other hospitals are giving it for free after the surgery is done. Each doctor consultation is 1100 rupees. For checking all the reports and BP they charged 1100rupees. For surgery they do have packages. For me the final and estimated cost was 230000 rupees. Since the cost of the surgery is more I haven't admitted at Narayana. They do have NH care App for the report results and doctor appointment bookings. Since I didn't go for surgery at Narayana Health they have removed all my report results from the app. I wasn't able to view any of my test reports from that app. And they have never given any access to my test reports. Called customer care number and requested for the reports. They asked me to visit the hospital for any help required.\n\nAdmitted to different hospital and the same surgery was done with the half of the price what Narayana Health was charging. Stockings were provided at free of cost. Transportation was provided. Picked up at my home location and dropped me back after surgery at free of cost. Appointments and timings are just for show off. You won't get your doctor appointment at the specified time. One full day is required to meet doctor and to come out of the hospital. Unnecessary tests will be done for a high price.\n\nNarayana Health hospital is money minded."

Patients families who are already on emotional rollercoaster ride are fed with stories of one pointer hope so that they can carry on paying the bills on false hopes. Once the doctors hit their revenue target per patient. They stage the death and the body is let go.

The admission personnel were professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. They guided me through the necessary paperwork swiftly, ensuring I understood each step of the process. Their empathetic approach made a potentially stressful situation feel manageable and straightforward.\n\nOnce admitted, the care provided by the nursing staff was nothing short of exemplary. The nurses were not only highly skilled but also incredibly compassionate. They attended to my needs promptly and with great care, always making sure I was comfortable and well-informed about my treatment. Their dedication to patient care was evident in every interaction, and they went above and beyond to ensure my well-being.\n\nThe hospital staff, including the doctors and support personnel, demonstrated a high level of professionalism and expertise. The doctors were thorough in their explanations, providing detailed information about my condition and the upcoming operation. They patiently answered all my questions, which greatly alleviated my concerns and built my confidence in the treatment plan.\n\nThe RN Tagore TPA (Third Party Administrator) Mr Pradip Kumar Saha and team at RN Tagore Hospital deserve special mention for their efficiency and supportive attitude. Navigating insurance processes can be daunting, but the TPA team handled everything with remarkable efficiency. They communicated clearly about the coverage, facilitated smooth transactions, and ensured that all necessary approvals were obtained promptly. Their assistance was invaluable in making the financial aspects of my hospital stay as hassle-free as possible.\n\nThe surgical team with Dr Asish Kumar Ghosh and Dr Satyadip Mukherjee displayed an impressive level of competence and coordination. My wife's operation was conducted with precision and care, and I felt reassured by their confident and professional demeanor. Post-surgery, the nursing staff continued to provide excellent care, ensuring a smooth recovery process.\n\nFinally, the discharge procedure was handled with the same level of professionalism and care that characterized my entire stay by Mr Arpan ke Bera and Ms Sukanya Muhuri and team. The discharge personnel ensured that all formalities were completed swiftly and that I received clear instructions for post-discharge care. They also arranged a follow-up schedule and provided contact information for any post-discharge queries, ensuring a smooth transition from hospital to home.\n\nIn summary, RN Tagore Hospital exceeded my expectations at every stage. The combination of skilled medical care, compassionate nursing, efficient administrative support, and comprehensive discharge planning made my experience outstanding. I highly recommend RN Tagore Hospital to anyone seeking high-quality medical care."

It was well maintained hygienic, the staff, nurse were calm and composed, they made sure I don't feel any pain during endoscopy. I had been suffering from severe vertigo's emerging due to gastric problems, after finding out the root cause which is H pylori, they gave me medicines which cured my disease within a month. I cant thank Dr shivakumar much enough because he was a god who helped me cure my disease. I would recommend people to visit narayana hospital as they have excellent modern techniques for diagnosing diseases."

Will make you to solve the puzzle how to get admitted. While you are doing this you will start experiencing stress mentally. Heart normally with start racing. Came and booked a bed on Friday 24 March morning for 78 year old mother for 28 march and we were made to sit for 4 hours. Mom is diabetic and she had to be given food. Insurance desk is dangerous. If you have insurance go there. Else you will need hospitalisation after dealing with the crooks there. The agency asked them to write the policy number clearly and they have no way of knowing that there is a reply. We have to go and tell them to check their inbox and they are supremely skilled to send you away with the query making it look complex so that you are put their sight. Terrible dept. Overall a pathetic hospital which cannot qualify for treatment. Stay away."

I am under the Doctor named Mr. S Pal who is a specialist in this section. Also the nurses behaviours are caring. One more important thing is that behind each bed there is a switch, if any patient wants to call the nurses (both male and female)he/she can press the bell anytime.\n\nWhen I had been admitted my Bilirobin showing as 20 but staying under treatment for 10 days my Bilirobin falls to 4 respectively.\n\nI was given Ice bump in my legs for 9 days and from the 10th day I feel no problem in my leg. For itching problems an ointment was provided to me. I had gone through MRI as well as blood tests too. The hospital is clean enough.\n\nThe infrastructure of the hospital is quite satisfactory but the fees of the hospital is expensive.\n\nAfter 10 days I was released from the hospital and advised by the doctor to take rests.\n\nAfter 1 month also my Bilorobin was at 4. Thereafter I moved to CMC, Vellore for further treatment and got 100 percent cured from there.\n\nI may suggest that you too can admit yourself or your nearest ones at NarayanaMultispeciality Hospitals for better treatment.\n\nThanks For Reading."
