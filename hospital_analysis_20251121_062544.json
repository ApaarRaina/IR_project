On completion of the surgery he again advised to be prepared for limb surgery that was already advised and performed limb surgery after 4 days without ascertaining the condition of patient . After limb surgery they told us the patient is fine but he developed swelling in the body that was termed as a normal post operative symptom that later worsened. Dr Firdous from Kulgam kashmir was addressing us and he continued with his inhuman procedures . Dr Firdous is the way to divert kashmiri patients . He was givin the duty to deal with us . When we complained about the condition of the patient they diagnosed him of acute pancriatites as they performed a CT that was never shared with us, after 5 painful days they changed the statement and diagnosed the patient of SEPSIS and put him on ventilator . When the condition of the patient worsened they accepted that they had ruptured a gut while performing surgery and within a week performed another surgery taking it to 3 surgeries instead of one. In these 38 days they killed us everyday moving the patient to ICU on ventilator and number of surgeries making a good amount of money from it.

She had stomach pain and was in great discomfort. After seeing her, Dr. Sood recommended to admit her immediately to the ward and we did so. She was admitted at 10:56am and doctors team came for visiting around 4pm. Till then she was in great pain. After examining doctors suggested for the surgery and said we need the previous CT scan films by tomorrow and left. Whole night she was given just normal salines and DNS and metrogyl iv infusions.\\n\\n7th January around 4am, she was not feeling well at all. I told sisters to check her but they said they do regular checkup for all patients around 6-7am and i have to wait. I was not even allowed to check her blood tests reports. They were so rude. Her bp started to fall down and then they call doctor and took decision to shift her to ICU9.\\n\\nThe worst phase of my mothers life actually started from there. When they took her to ICU9, they asked me to sign consent form for centre line arterial line and ventilator. They were so prepared in advance for what to do with the patients. They tried there hands on and on and around 10am they told me that they examined her through XRay (which we never got) and found that her intestine got ruptured and immediately need to operate her. With no other option left, we allowed and operation on high risk was done for 3hours.\\n\\nThey told she is fine and maintaing her bp but still in danger. We saw her graph of improvement going for 5 days. On the 6th day of operation, they took her for CTScan on UG floor andshe was exposed to infections and on such an unstable condition they performed SLEDD dialysis. Her bp again fluctuated from this. From that only her health started to deteriorate. Again after 8hours of sledd session, just to make money, they told me to pay for CRRT dialysis. We agreed. But again her bp started to fluctuate and this time she couldnot fight back and she died.\\n\\nI cant explain how much in pain she was. They just treated her like an experimenting body. They inserted one catherer one one side other cattherer from the other side. Whole body was actually punched. She was a great fighter but couldnot fight the pain the medanta people gave. She was conscious and wanted to speak, she wanted them to open her she tried she expressed but these people were so so so sooooo heatless that they didnt even care. Unfortunately she left.\\n\\nAnd talking about the transparency, everything in this hospital is just soooo one sided. Being attendant you will not even get to know what are they giving to your patient. They have 1 counselling session in the morning for 5min and 2visinting hours for 15 each. Other than that whatever they are doing is just in their hands and is just so one sided. But during her last hours, they called me to show that they are trying to give her chest compressions. Just to be assure and show that they are trying.\\n\\nPlease Please Please do not go to this hospital ever ever in your life. Please save your patients life by not going there.

On March 25, I underwent a full-mouth laser gingival curettage and received a crown-and-bridge placement which involved exorbitant charges of INR86, 859(over USD1, 000), plus INR9, 567 for a root canal. Upon returning to Tanzania, on April 14 I noticed the crowns beginning to chip, and within a week they had completely detached. When I reported this to the Dental Department, I was offered a complimentary replacement bridge but this would involve local dentist consultation in Tanzania, digital impressions, bite registration, and subsequent refitting at my own cost. I declined the offer, not only due to the expense but also because of my concerns about the crowns quality and the risks of coordinating two different dentists across countries. Instead, I requested a full refund of my total treatment cost(INR96, 426).\\n\\nSince no agreement was reached, I escalated the matter to the International Patients Department. I received a notification stating that an International Patients Representative would contact me. However, I have not heard from anyone.

His regular medications were changed without proper explanation, and we were kept in the dark about critical decisions.\\n\\nStudent doctors handled his case with minimal supervision, and the senior staff, including the head nurse, were unapproachable and rude. Even the basic courtesy you'd expect from support staff like ICU cleaners was missing.\\n\\nMost shockingly, without any informed consent from our family, they placed him on an invasive ventilator and conducted X-ray. Within just two days of admission, we tragically lost him.\\n\\nTo make things worse, the hospital delayed issuing the death report, making us run around for two more days while we were already grieving.\\n\\nUnless you have influence or strong connections, you might not receive the care and attention you deserve here. For us, it was a heartbreaking and irreparable loss. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"source\": \"MouthShut\",\n        \"hospital\": \"Narayana\",\n        \"review\": \"\\\"DEADLY NEGLIGENCE AT MEDICA HOSPITALDO NOT TRUST DR. AMLAN MANDAL\\\"\\n\\nIt is with deep grief, anguish, and a heavy heart that I write this review. My father, aged 63 years, was admitted to Medica Superspecialty Hospital, Kolkata on 23rd February 2025, under the care of Dr. Amlan Mandal. What we believed would be a short-term observation for a manageable condition turned into a devastating loss, due to sheer medical negligence, arrogance, and lack of empathy.\\n\\nMy father was generally fit and active for his age. He suddenly fell ill, lost bowel control, and was found to have an old blood clot and a mild reaction to recent medications. Based on this, we rushed him to Medica for emergency admission. After initial tests, the doctors themselves told us that the condition was not as serious as we fearedthe blood clots were old and manageable, and the primary issue was an electrolyte imbalance(sodium-potassium levels). With basic treatment, his condition improved within hourshe was walking, talking, and feeling normal.\\n\\nDespite his rapid improvement, the medical team insisted on keeping him for just two more days for observation. Our family was inclined to bring him home, but we were convinced to let him stay, thinking it was the safer optiona decision we now deeply regret.\\n\\nFrom Day 2 onwards, the situation took a mysterious and alarming turn. The doctors began pointing out new symptoms every dayissues with food consumption, oxygen imbalance, discomfort. They inserted a Ryles tube(nasogastric tube) even though my father had no swallowing issues initially. They placed him on oxygen support, and later diagnosed a lung infection that had never existed before his hospital admission. This infection spiraled out of control, and they utterly failed to detect or manage it properly.\\n\\nThroughout this time, Dr. Amlan Mandal and his team were dismissive, rude, and extremely difficult to communicate with. Every time we asked for clarification or questioned the declining health of our loved one, we were met with condescending responses like, \\\"Do you understand more than us?\\\". Dr. Mandal carried himself with an air of superiority, completely ignoring the legitimate concerns of family members who were watching a loved one deteriorate before their eyes.\\n\\nWhen the Ryles tube was inserted, my father visibly showed discomfort and distressmoving his legs, adjusting his posturesigns which were ignored by the medical staff. And because he was moved to the ICU, we were cut off from monitoring his care closely, unable to intervene or transfer him to another hospital once we realized things were spiraling out of control. We were simply told to wait and trust the processa process that ultimately led to his death.\\n\\nWhats even more disturbing is what one of the hospital staff told our family driver, who was crying on the day of the passing:\\n\\nThis hospital is nothing but a business. Its a place of death, not care.\\n\\nThat one sentence said everything we had felt but couldnt believethat our trust had been horribly misplaced. My father entered this hospital walking and talking, and within 10 days, he was gonenot because of the original condition, but because of the negligence, mishandling, and egotistical approach of Dr. Amlan Mandal and his team.\\n\\nThis review is not written out of impulseits a warning to families who are considering placing their loved ones under his care. Our biggest mistake was trusting him and this hospital. Please, dont make the same one.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"source\": \"MouthShut\",\n        \"hospital\": \"Narayana\",\n        \"review\": \"SUMMARY\\n\\nmy old aged mother at 77 yrs was kept for 16 days in ICU & LOST her LIFE due to wrong promises & ignorance by Doctors & ICU team\\n\\nSTORY - unbelievable\\n\\nwith lot hopes & trust on Dr.Vivekananda Gajapati , we admitted my mother , 77 yrs senior old woman on 26.01.2025 who had breathlessness issue.\\n\\nDr.Vivekananda told us to go for open heart surgery & not to hear any words of my mother\\n\\nthe first day I told doctor - will keep my mother in ward & incase of breathlessness will need your observation & checkup\\n\\nbut Dr.Vivekananda straight away told we have to admit my mother to ICU only\\n\\ndue to bad experience in ICU earlier, we did not want but because of Dr pressure we admitted to ICU with only left TRUST\\n\\nmy mother was good first day, had good natural night sleep post many days wo any oxygen\\n\\n2nd night on 27.01.2025 > i just entered ICU accidently at 4am & found my mother struggling with breathlessness fully sweating , in dark, no AC & no doctors or nurses to attend her\\n\\nI Immediately called doctors & nurses & got nebuliser given & my mother was ok after 30min\\n\\ninsisted ICU staff to take care of my mother, going forward\\n\\n3rd night - at 10pm - mother started shivering with cold in the stomach while having dinner - all doctors & nurses rushed in , my mother got panic- tried to come out of the bed- shouting please discharge me.\\n\\nhe was forced to bed by nurses & doctors & gave sleeping dose & took my signature for ventilation & next morning on 29.01.2025 - I see my mother on ventilation- mouth shut - cannot express or disclose nothing from heart what she wants to tell\\n\\nventilation was supposed to be opened after 48 hrs by anistia Dr.pramod - but Dr.Vivekananda straight away declined & asked not to remove this ventilation till angiogram & surgery on monday 03.02.2025still 3 days to go as the senior surgeon Dr.Suraj was on leave till Sunday\\n\\nmy old aged mother (77yrs) was with only liquid food & was very weak till surgery day & got fever of 109 degrees\\n\\nbut still was taken for surgery in this BAD morher condition by senior surgeon Dr.Sai Suraj\\n\\nwe were told by Dr.Vivekananda also that all organs are working well except heart - will get resolved this heart issue also with this surgery done - gavelot of hopes\\n\\nhanded over my mother to Dr Sai Suraj & just washed his hands & responsibility\\n\\nDr.Sai Suraj operated my mother in 6 yrs & told operation successful - we all family were happy & thanked Dr.for this success\\n\\n2 days gone, , on wed 05.02.2025 , ventilation was replaced with oxygen - but post 4 hrs - my mother got unconscious & was again replaced with ventilator\\n\\nDr.Sai Suraj tells next day morning thu 06.01.2025I'm not there again for next 2 days & will return back on Sunday 09.02.2025\\n\\nwe got panic , my mother was this difficult stage & Dr is taking off\\n\\nDr Sai suraj gave us confidence that his team will take care of my mother well\\n\\nthe same day night - the ICU doctor Dr.Chandrashekar tells me - your mother is very weak was on ventilation before surgery last week & also aged - so she is not able to breath back\\n\\nI was shocked with this statement.
