MouthShut,Fortis,"Im truly grateful to Dr. Shalini Maam and Co-ordinator Poornima Maam for their excellent support throughout my medical examination process. Their guidance was smooth, professional, and reassuring. Thank you both for making the experience stress-free and efficient!"
MouthShut,Fortis,This hospital is nothing but a fraud please beware of this and do not trust any doctor. the diagnosis is wrong the doctors just make money and can do anything to just earn money. they can suggests surgery when its not needed just to make money. just do not go.
MouthShut,Fortis,"In my personal experience, Dr. Arvind Sahni is the worst doctor I have ever encountered, and I would strongly advise others to avoid seeking treatment from him.

My mother was undergoing cancer treatment and, after completion, she remained cancer-free for approximately three months. Subsequently, she developed a tracheoesophageal fistula, which we were informed was a possible side effect of radiotherapy.

In managing this condition, Dr. Arvind Sahni recommended and carried out the placement of an esophageal stent. After this procedure, my mother developed serious complications affecting her heart, lungs, windpipe all of which had been perfectly healthy before the stent was inserted. Her condition declined rapidly, and she suffered intense pain for nearly a month before she passed away. Before the procedure, we had asked about possible risks, but we were not informed about such complications. When these complications happened and we asked him for answers, he was rude, uncaring, and did not help us.

We trusted him to make my mother better, but instead, she got worse and lost her life. From my experience, his treatment and care were very bad and I believe no one should risk their loved ones lives with him."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Thank you, Shayam, for your great support and dedication. Truly appreciate your efforts!""

MouthShut,Fortis,"We are incredibly grateful to Fortis Hospital for the timely and exceptional care provided during a very critical moment for our family. On the 7th of July, we had to rush my pregnant wife to the hospital in an emergency as she suffered an eclampsia attack around 4:30 AM. It was a terrifying situation, but the hospital staff responded with remarkable efficiency and compassion.

We would like to extend our deepest thanks to Dr. Sonal Kumta, Dr. Rajen Doshi, Dr Farah, Dr Sukhada, Dr Sonuli, ICU staff, Emergency Staff, NICU staff for their prompt diagnosis and expert medical attention. Their calm and confident approach truly made all the difference in managing the crisis and ensuring the safety of both mother and baby.

A special mention must go to Mr. Shyamsunder Nirgun from the security team, who went far beyond his duty. His reassuring words and support gave us courage during one of the most difficult moments of our lives. Its rare to come across people like him who bring so much humanity to their role.

Thank you, Fortis, for being a pillar of strength in our time of need. We will always remember your care and kindness."
MouthShut,Fortis,"This is the not the first time we visited FORTIS Bannaerghatta Branch. This Hospital has always given my family a good medical care and treatment. My Father has recently undergone a Radiation treatment under the guidance of Dr N.Madhusudan and team. For us, since admission to the completion of Treatment, it was hassle free. Doctor made us understand the Gravity of the situation and boosted the Morale of family members, which gave us courage to face the treatment.

All the Supporting medical staff in radiation department were really so much supportive in the process of treatment."

Patient name Asha Singh was admitted in icu 3 bed number 1313 in fortis health care mulund the security officer Mr Shyam sundar nirgun guide us with necessary step and good human gesture with full support to patientrelative in need."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Just wanted to take a moment to appreciate the hospitals security staff. In such a stressful time for families, their presence and behavior really made a difference. Theyve been extremely professional, but more importantly, very calm and respectful with everyone.

Chahe ICU ka entry ho ya emergency area ka rush, they handled everything smoothly, bina kisi gusse ya attitude ke. Its not easy to manage so many people with different emotions some scared, some angry, some confused but they maintained discipline with a lot of patience.

Specially liked how they explained rules politely instead of just saying no. At times when we were emotionally drained, unka ek simple guide kar dena ya calmly baat karna felt very supportive."
MouthShut,Fortis,"What a terrible experience we had this time. If you donot have hold on a resourceful doctor at Fortis hospital Kolkata then you are finished. They will make your life hell.

Since past few months, Fortis Kolkata, Anandapur, have degraded with very menial quality doctors. All renowned, genuinely honest, expert doctors, staff have left Fortis as they refused to surrender to undue, corrupt demands of the administration. We have witnessed, experienced. Doctors like Yashesh Paliwal, Sandip Mondal, Dibyendyu Mukherjee are part ners in such activities and those who are tagged with them are cursed. Tgey neither know their subject nor they have traces of their conscience. They take patients on a ride... Escalated medical bills and self well being is the motto of Fortis hospital Kolkata now.

STAY AWAY FROM FORTIS."
MouthShut,Fortis,"We have admitted in ICU 1209 Security staff Shyam sunder is very professional and excellent guidance quality. Very helpful nature strict towards hospital rules.

Really appreciated his working quality and helping nature. Need this type of security staff in hospital.good example for other security staff."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I want to thank Dr. Harsimrat Bir Singh Sodhi from the bottom of my heart for his outstanding knowledge at a crucial moment. My mother was not able to walk due to compression in his backbone when I went to the doctor, but thank God, and of course, Dr. Sodhi knowledge in Spine surgery is extremely impressive, and the outcomes speak for themselves.Our gratitude for having such a skilled and kind surgeon by our side is immense.A doctor of his quality is a blessing for Fortis Mohali.Excellently suggested."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Mr Vijay Sawant is admitted in fortis hospital room no. 1810.

We met Mr. Shamsundar Nirgun at OT. He guided us very well .. He is very respectful and professional.."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. V.K. Khosla for his exceptional expertise during a very critical time.When I approached to the doctor, i was clueless about my life, my family , but thanks ?? to god and ofcourse Dr. Khosla's skill in brain surgery is truly commendable, and the results speak volumes about his experience and precision. We are incredibly thankful to have had such a compassionate and competent surgeon by our side. Fortis Mohali is fortunate to have a doctor of his caliber. Highly recommended.

Thanks

MouthShut,Fortis,"Hello all,

Nowadays bigger hospital started taking operation cost like big scam money. We have undergone prostrate surgery for our father-in-law

Intial estimated charge is 6 lacs.They made 10lacs.

Even though we have insurance these hospital people only claiming them 7.30lacs.The remaining amount we are asking to claim means they are saying it's development and donation for the hospital. Also so many extra charges they put it's just scamming with earned people.Coming to management it's worst experience. On the 5th day of operation he was facing gastric and breathing issue.From morning keep doctors coming and checking , OT is not free , scan also busy end of the day nothing they did.He suffered lot.Next day they checked. Also so much money you need to give to the nurses also everytime to shift Patient to from ward to scans and other blood tests taking.Please it's very bad hospital and management. It's mu kind request to all don go.fell in sprider web."

MouthShut,Fortis,"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Shyam Sundar Nirgun, the security guard at Fortis Hospital, for his exceptional kindness and empathy during our visit. In a stressful and emotional situation, he went above and beyond his duty to comfort us and ensure we felt safe.

His calm demeanor and reassuring words truly made a difference, helping us stay composed when we needed it the most. It is rare to find someone in his role who not only performs their job diligently but also shows such genuine care for people.

Your kindness will always be remembered! Fortis Hospital is fortunate to have such a dedicated and empathetic individual on their team"
MouthShut,Fortis,I am undergoing a treatment in fortis.Everytime after consulting the doctor i buy medicines from pharmacy.There is a Staff in Pharmacy Nazim is really very cooperative.Everytime listen very carefully & give complete medicines & yesterday i bring my old medicines to him as well & he checked all the medicines without getting irritated & give me the new medicines & completed the incomplete medicines which i have.The way He handle a hectic situation in rush of patients with calmness is impressive..
MouthShut,Fortis,I had booked a consultation for my mom in ortho department and while booking i asked explicitly if the doctor will be available as it was noon time. They called me one day before to confirm that I will be coming.We reached half hour early to pay the fee and wait for doctor.Even after two hours they kept telling me that doctor will come in 10min. My mom was tired and we had come for consultation about her knee replacement surgery. She said if this is the treatment she gets when we go for consultation then she does not want to do the surgery from this hospital. We came back without showing the doctor. Our consultation fee and cab fee and time was wasted. It is a pity that the hospital considers that patients dont have any work and their time is of no value. The doctor was in a scheduled surgery which means they were aware that he cannot take consultation at the time alloted for my mom. Then why give a booking? Very disappointed with Fortis.
MouthShut,Fortis,I am very happy with the result I got by following diet plan for my hypothyroid issue for 3 months.i have been suffering from hypothyriod and with weight since 2years and I am very surprised also with the result after following the diet plan that maam had suggested me. I am feeling energatic and happy. I have lost 8kgs and looking forward for more to reduce. Thank you Dt. Neenu chambial maam for your guiddens with your knowledge. I will like to suggest everyone to come to maam who are suffering from any disease. She is the best dietitian.

MouthShut,Fortis,"Forties management what do you do , you should see why people are leaving their jobs in your shalimar bagh delhi branch . Especially girls, there are some people in your branch in Shalimar Bagh who move around in groups, harass girls and ask for sexual favours from them. After not giving sexual favours, if they do not listen to them, they harass them from their duty. They do not give them duty and say go back to home, And the Gents Ward Boys there in connivance with the site manager and supervisor also try to molest the girl patients when they are sleeping or unconscious during treatment. Management and Owner, you should check the record of last 1 to 2 years as to left the job and how many girls are there among them and group boss is site manager goutam kumar and the two people sorubh choudhary and udham singh, we are waiting from your prompt and best response and resolution.

Thanks ????"
MouthShut,Fortis,"I took my mother to Dr. Adarsh, a vascular surgeon, for the treatment of long-neglected and complicated varicose veins. Through laser treatment, he effectively treated her condition with remarkable patience and expertise. The surgery lasted 3-4 hours, and his precision was commendable. The follow-up care, including wound dressing and monitoring, was smooth and thorough. Now, after three weeks, my mother is doing well and highly satisfied with the results. I truly appreciate Dr. Adarsh’s skill and dedication and highly recommend him for varicose vein treatment."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I had the worst experience at Fortis Hospital Nagarbhavi last night. My mother was advised by the doctors and nurses to undergo a CT scan, so she was admitted and given intravenous fluids. Unfortunately, this treatment made her feel dizzy. Afterward, they suddenly prepped her to be transferred to Rajajinagar without informing us why.

We were completely unaware that the CT scan machine at their facility was not working, and no one from the emergency ward communicated this to us. When we questioned why they were transferring my mom to a different location, they claimed they didn’t know about the malfunctioning machine. It was incredibly frustrating to learn this only after we inquired.

To make matters worse, when we addressed our concerns with the manager, the response was rude and dismissive, spoken with arrogance. As a family, we expected clear communication, especially during an emergency, but unfortunately, Fortis Hospital failed on that front.

It was an incredibly distressing situation that could have been handled much better. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on improving their communication and customer service. We will certainly think twice before considering this hospital again."
MouthShut,Fortis,The oncology doctor team don't know if they are just practicing surgery on a Thyroid cancer patient or just another way to incur money from patient. Either they are not clear what they doing or just wasting a patient life or practicing their hands on surgery. 2 months ago a surgery happened and a 3 lymph node removed. But in 1.5 months again the lymph node came back. What surgery they did? Don't they know what they are treating?
MouthShut,Fortis,"Thank you officer Nirgun for your kind support.

I had a family member in the ICU . Officer was very helpful to us relatives .He manages all anxious relatives with kindness and helps as much as he can.

God bless him??"

MouthShut,Fortis,"Right from the moment I was rolled into his chamber he has been nothing less than an angel.

His knowledge and love for his profession clearly reflects in the way he deals with his patients. He took me through each step of surgical journey to help me decide and make an informed decision. Not for a minute was I scared as I knew I was in great hands. Thank you doc for always greeting me with a smile and answering 100’s of questions(since I ask too many) and giving me a better quality of life. Patients like me are blessed to have docs like you .

To many more greets and fist bumps

The operation went well and the recovery was also without any complications which is a tribute to Dr. Sodhi.

What was exceptional was the extraordinary length to which Dr. Sodhi went to accommodate the needs of our autistic child. There are too many things to list.

Overall, doctor is very professional, empathetic, answers all questions with detailed answers and genuinely cares for his patients and the caregivers."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Harsimrat Bir Singh Sodhi. After undergoing surgery, I have experienced significant relief from my back pain.

MouthShut,Fortis,"My dad is admitted in Fortis for chemotherapy. First of all, I want to thanks Dr ketan for his support and guidance. He is such a kind hearted and experienced oncologist...

Now come to nursing staff... Services of nursing staff is deteriorating.... Nurses are not well experienced. While injecting injections, nurses cause lot of pain which shows their low capability and no empathy for the patient.

They don't bother to give medicines to the patient. Attendant of the patient have to ask everything again and again. Junior doctors have no role in the wards.. no concern for the patient at all ... Really disappointed this time ...."

From the very beginning, they took the time to explain the procedure in detail, addressing all our concerns with patience and clarity.

Their calm and compassionate demeanor gave me immense confidence and comfort during a challenging time. The post-operative care and follow-ups have been equally remarkable, showing a genuine commitment to my mother’s recovery.

Also i would like to mention Ms Sandeep, Dr. Naval’s assistant also helped us throughout in every step.

Thank you for your tireless efforts not just for my mother but for all those you help every day."

MouthShut,Fortis,"Refer the ATTACHED ONLINE COMPLAINT LODGED with DELHI POLICE and attached SMS screenshots and note that my father - Sh. Gulshan Bhatla, a patient of Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi over the years has lost his life on 13th Nov'24 early morning due to super world class services of Fortis Hospital.

As my father was feeling unwell, I called the Emergency Ambulance Service using the Fortis App with my first call at around 12.24 am on 13th Nov'24 where I have been confirmed that Ambulance has been left out for my father and as requested, I shared my location via link received on sms but surprisingly that Ambulance has never reached my place.

After waiting for several minutes, when condition of my father started deteriorating, I made multiple calls to the Ambulance Services to which I have been refused stating - There is no bed in the hospital. I pleaded the Hospital's Ambulance Services to come and take the patient atleast to the Emergency Services for immediate relief and in case of any issues, send the Ambulance to take him to any other hospital but request was turned down and finally, my father passed away and left this World due to clear lapses in services from Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi 110088.

Similar issue happened on 5th Sep'24 also and after the horrible Ambulance Services, I was assured that such type of incident is not going to happen again which turned out to completely false on 12th and 13th Night and taken away the valuable life of my father.

Hence, request your immediate intervention and action in the matter as this valueable loss of my father's life due to failure of Fortis Hospital services cannot be tolerated.

Although, matter has been escalated via multiple mails to MD and CEO of Fortis Healthcare - Mr. Ashutosh Raghuwanshi and other mail ids of Fortis Hospital where no positive response has been received from the Hospital and with this, it is clear that there is no value of life in the dictionary of Fortis Hospital which straight-away calls stern legal action against the Hospital starting with License Cancellation of the Hospital immediately in Public Interest.

MouthShut,Fortis,"Just because the hospital is built in front of IIM B, doesn’t mean Fortis should turn into money making organisation, through just charging lakhs and thousands of rupees from a patient. No patient would like to die in arms if doctors or nurses when there is a loving family behind them. Had a horrible experience with Fortis. We as a common folk go to big hospital because the best doctors and nurses are hired there, Who are known for their care and hospitality to ensure the patient does not lose hope.

My aunt had a shoulder fracture due to a fall at home. First aid was done at her hometown. Fortis is the first name which comes in mind for best care, hence we rushed her to Bannergatta Road Fortis emergency on 31st October 2024 10:00 pm. Duty doctor examined and said no worries she can leave, the time around 11:30 pm. Then the drama started her sugar level is high she needs immediate attention and has to be hospitalised for one day. No one wants to ignore, like anyone else we said we should get her admitted. Patient registration number: 13480909/ iPid 259018/ 24/1113

The room was given on 1st November 12:15 am, But the billing ensured the room charge of 31st October also included. This is a protocol hence we charge basis on the registration time. The lady who asked me for the deposit said, that’s not my job. Tomorrow meet the admin and bargain.

Then another duty doctor named Prashanth in the threatening voice said, if we don’t get the brain CT scan, then if something happens to her in the midnight, hospital is not responsible for patient’s condition as the patient had mentioned she had consulted an ENT for ear pain previous day and she had been given medication.Then we asked the cost of the scan. The employee out there said, during govt holidays and other long weekends the charges are double it will cost 4, 000. We said ok. Next early morning we got to know everything was normal as per CT Scan. Then Dr Sheela, the general physician somehow made it despite her personal commitment. Her statement - we should examine the reason for her fall. May be it’s related to cardiology or nerves. Let the cardiologist examine. Forcefully explained the logic of ECO not needed. No problem was the statement made by neurologist too. Also mentioned about threatening services that the hospital provides because the hospital Machines must be running continuously to maximise the capacity.

Then suggested ultrasound test “just” to ensure there is no problem with kidney or liver. The report said all ok. By then the day passed. Discharge did not happen on 1st November. The most important treatment of ortho was IGNORED. Silly reason the shoulder band size was not available. They managed to convince the smaller size will fit. Consumables were charged but it gets used for treating other patients. The patient looked unhygienic. Did not bother even to change the gown or sheet or give a sponge bath. Despite multiple complaints. Dear doctors would you allow someone from your family suffer like this? Would you threaten your family to get the scan done because you need to show the machine capacity utilisation? Make money and profits, you are in the business but not at the cost of patient's life. By the way my aunt was charged 70, 000 for nothing but to treat her sugar and BP. She never had cough but you suggested mucolite. There was no consultation of ortho no medication prescribed for her ear pain. But we paid the consultation fees of physiotherapist and dietitian. Be mindful and hope this reaches to other patients and their near ones. Whoever is reading this, please ensure this doesn’t happen to you or your near ones."

Her knowledge of breastfeeding techniques and lactation issues is exceptional. She provided practical tips and support that made a noticeable difference in my breastfeeding journey. What stood out most was her patience and encouragement, which helped me build confidence during a challenging time.

Additionally, Dr. Rabia was always available for follow-up questions, demonstrating her commitment to her clients.

Making money is their criteria only . For them patient's are like money machine.Doctor's hardly care after surgery.The best part is they give wrong commitments regarding your insurance.Add so many useless expenses in the final bills after the surgery. Never ever think of Fortis. You will be looted if you ever gone.

Experience is not satisfactory. They hardly care about patient's. There primary focus is only money."

I chose Fortis for birth of my child, after delivering my baby these NICU people hijacked the baby. When I recovered from my trauma of giving birth I wanted to see my baby but these stubborn people start imposing the stupid rules like we are now allowed to meet the baby at night. I was not able to sleep whole night knowing have to wait till morning.

Everything I sent my husband to see the baby from outside he was crying and later doctor over there warned him that they will call security and told even from outside you can't see your baby.

I was already emotionally broken and such attitude from the doctor is making it worse for me. I was traumatized knowing my baby is crying continously and I can't even go there to see him"
MouthShut,Fortis,"We went fortis hospital for my mother's spine problem.

She is not feeling any pain after the operation.

We thankful to Dr. Harsimrat sodhi sir and Gurmeet mam for their cooperation.

Thank you so much fortis hospital and team."
MouthShut,Fortis,"After reading this… definitely you would feel even one STAR is more…, they should get negative stars.

1. Can you imagine some problems(may be Money) in between management and doctors, just before surgery?

2. Can you imagine surgery would cancel just a few hours before because of management and doctors' issues, though patient is 100% fit for surgery?

• My hernia surgery was scheduled on 17th morning(Jul 17th, 2024) and staff asked me to join on 16th around 2PM.

• We went to Fortis, Bannergatta Road Hospital at 2 PM on 16th.

• 3PM… No room. 4PM … No room. 5PM…, no room. Their standard answer, “one patient is going to vacate, some insurance problem. So takes some time”.

• Finally at 7 PM, they called for room. Again more than one hour paper work, they asked me to pay 1 Lakh rupees in advance.

• Finally we admitted into room # 749 at 8:30.

• Room is so bad, bathroom door is making lot of sound, but this review is not for room.

• After 8:30 PM, nurse came, collected the papers.

• Around 9 PM, Anastasia's doctor came and double checked. In this way before 10:30 PM, several doctors came and certified for surgery(routine checkup).

• At 10:40 PM…, NEVER EXPECTED WORST THING happened.

• One doctor came and said….”Some problems in between Management and surgeons, so no surgery for tomorrow, you can go home”. REALLY, WE GOT SHOCKED.

• Surgery canceled! Imagine this is some heart operation instead of hernia. Patient would have died.(I heard someday 2 patients died, I don't know the reason)

• They don’t think about patient's mindset, their family's mindset, corresponding prayers etc. Simply Surgery canceled, because of money.

• They have not return my one Lakh rupees even after 2 weeks(Taken surgery in another hospital though).

• I NEVER EVER SUGGEST THIS FORTIS."
MouthShut,Fortis,Fortis boasts of being one of the private hospitals in the region. But the dismal service is being provided at the hospital after charging exorbitant rates. I had to wait for about 3 hours at the IPD to get admitted Instead of being date and time of admission. Everyone will be astonished to note that it took more than 7 hours to get discharged. Not only this the hospital charged rent for the day despite being their fault in discharging. The same room was given to another patient on the same day and he probably would have been charged. So one room was charged from two persons for the same day. The patients are being harrased as there is no one to supervise the working of the staff and no of employees is also inadequate to cater to the rush of patients at the hospital.
MouthShut,Fortis,"I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Harsimrat Bir Singh Sodhi for performing my spine surgery with such incredible skill and compassion. At just 16, I was extremely scared, but his calm, kind, and reassuring nature made all the difference. I am amazed and so happy that there was no pain at all. Dr. Sodhi is truly the best neurosurgeon, and I feel so fortunate to have been under his care. Thank you for your outstanding work and for making this experience so much easier for me."

MouthShut,Fortis,"On 16th July, I was scheduled to undergo Angiogram by Dr Shashidhar, an eminent cardiologist.

When I arrived the customer service officer Shobhita at admission counter was busy checking her WhatsApp messages.

Then in the cathlab, one inexperienced and pathetic staff nurse pushed the catheter into my right arm with so much force, I could not use my right hand for 2 weeks.

Not only that, the doctor who saw my angio report neglected to give me medication for hypertension due to which I had to rush to Chinmaya Mission hospital and get second opinion and get the right dosage of the right medication to manage BP.

I highly recommend patients to go to either Baptist hospital or Chinmaya mission hospital as Fortis is extremely mo"

MouthShut,Fortis,"As someone who recently had the misfortune of requiring medical attention, my experience at Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh was disappointing and disheartening. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was met with an atmosphere of inefficiency and apathy that permeated every aspect of my visit.

First and foremost, the wait times were abysmal. Despite being in obvious discomfort and distress, I was left languishing in the waiting room for what felt like an eternity before even being seen by a nurse, let alone a doctor. The lack of urgency and organization was evident, with no clear prioritization of patients based on the severity of their condition.

Once I was finally ushered into a treatment room, the ordeal only continued. The medical staff appeared overworked and disinterested, rushing through the examination with minimal communication or bedside manner. It was abundantly clear that I was just another number to them, rather than a person in need of compassionate care.

Furthermore, the cleanliness of the facility left much to be desired. The surfaces were visibly dirty, and I couldn't shake the feeling of unease knowing that proper sanitation protocols were seemingly being neglected. In a place where health and hygiene should be paramount, such lapses are inexcusable and potentially dangerous.

To add insult to injury, the billing process was a nightmare. Despite having insurance, I was hit with exorbitant charges for services that were neither explained nor justified. It felt like yet another instance of the hospital prioritizing profit over the well-being of its patients, leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth long after I left its doors.

Overall, my experience at Fortis Hospital Shalimar Bagh was a stark reminder of the failings within our healthcare system. From interminable wait times to indifferent staff and subpar facilities, it's clear that this institution is more concerned with cutting corners than providing quality care. Unless significant improvements are made, I wouldn't recommend this hospital to anyone needing medical attention."

And also our patient lost his life becomes missing of treatment on time. I think these hospitals should not allow to treat and give them international kind of practice and promotion which they really not able to do. Or might be they are good or having expertise in treating international patient who gives them big bucket of bucks.

My advice exprience do not go there for critical diseases treatment.

They are focusing more on advertising and Extension to looting the people put them in ICU till the time u have money or insurance."

MouthShut,Fortis,"My mother went there and was operated, laprotomy and then ileostomy was performed. In spite of our million efforts her health kept deteriorating. She was hospitalized there 5 times every 10 days where sepsis was diagnosed. They knew that she got sepsis but no proper treatment was done. She was again hospitalised for low bp and they kept her in ICU.2nd day they put her on ventilator and she was unconscious all the time.3 rd day they said she is too sick and will die soon. No one even any doctor was seeing after her. They didn't even try to save her. Atlast she died there. Billing was done and they made 7 lakhs of bill where they charged 5000 rs for dental kit and 10000 rs for physiotherapy. When she was on ventilator and unconscious how she can do exercises with physiotherapy. Dostors were unable to treat sepsis instead kept giving her medicines for UTI. They started running away when we asked questions. They didnt only play with the emotions but, they snatched the world from us. If there is any God above, such people should also go through this pain with what we all are going through. Shame on such doctors who keep misguiding people and break them emotionally and financially."

MouthShut,Fortis,"A torture chamber for infants/ pre term babies.

Please don’t even think of admitting your newborns to Fortis NICU.

As an unfortunate mother of 2 extremely pre term born babies, i saw them going through hell. They were left crying for hours, diapers unchanged for more than 3 hours , everyday nail marks on diaper areas, mosquito bites all over their face. The nurses were busy gossiping amongst themselves or watching videos ( heartless monsters) and the doctors were just waiting for my babies to die( least bothered about any feedback given by parents during one on one useless meetings). Filthy nurses wearing unwashed stinky clothes, unwashed utensil’s used to feed infants (so called KC aka katori chamach with leftover milk stains, , stinky toilets, outdated infants open cots whose sirens go on for no reason literally making the infants howl and more stressful. ( gosh i hope nobody’s baby has to go through this ordeal).

My twin 1 left eye was damaged during his 3 months stay, he has multiple bruises on his body due to forceful tapes pulling by untrained so called nurses. Twin 2 got internal bleeding in her brain due to banging of the baby with force during her stay (internal bleeding report captured during MRI scan), ongoing high bp issue due to wrong medication given during the stay and has multiple bruises/marks on her stomach area and hands. These people would go to any extent to JUST blame the helpless MOTHER FOR ANY FEEDBACK given. I would especially like to mention a nurse named KAVITA (untrained and uncultured from Himachal) who was literally a heartless woman who would NEVER EVER bother about the infants howling in NICU or any ongoing machine sirens and was always busy watching telly soaps on her phone or gossiping with her family on phone that too on speaker mode.

PLEASE DO NOT TORTURE YOUR PRECIOUS BABIES BY ADMITTING them TO FORTIS NICU."

MouthShut,Fortis,"Have been visiting this hospital multiple times in the last few months for my Dad's cancer treatment. I have availed almost all the hospital services during this tenure. One of the major things which I would like to highlight here is that mismanagement of OPD appointments and the doctor's waiting time. Doesn't matter whether you book the appointment online or via call, the doctors are never available on time. I am currently writing this review while waiting for an OPD appointment here at the hospital. The appointment was scheduled for 5:40 and it's almost 8 PM now. In between I have received communication through the reception ( only upon asking) that the doctor will be coming in half an hour or so....this is not the first time. I have faced this situation on multiple occasions. In the course of treatment, many a times my dad was admitted also.... everytime the staff approaches you after the discharge to write a good review with best ratings...but the services are never up to the mark. It is less of a hospital and more of a profit oriented organisation which is set up for minting money for the promoters."

MouthShut,Fortis,Senior Security staff Shyam Nirgun has guided us very well. He is very cooperative. Thank you for the service provided
MouthShut,Fortis,"When a person is supposed to undergo surgery, not only the person who is undergoing surgery but also the whole family is under a lot of stress. Everyone in the family including the patient wants the best of hospitals for treatment. In case of my wife's surgery, the case was complicated and things were not as smooth as it would seem to be. She was under a lot of pain due to gallbladder stones.

We were asked to get MRCP done for which appointment had to be taken. I became nervous as I wanted my wife to get treatment immediately so that she could be relieved of her pain. Went to the MRI hall and was told by the patients waiting there that it could take up to 15 days to get the MRCP done which made me further nervous. I approached the person who deals with MRI and explained to him the whole matter. The person was kind enough to see through the whole matter and kindly gave us

an earlier date. I am thankful to this person who could sense the difficult stage that my wife was in.

With all the tests completed, approached Dr. Atul Joshi who guided us to the surgery date. Dr. Atul Joshi is a surgeon who has many years of experience under his belt and notably armed with a fantastic smile, always willing to help. As they say, half of the patient's disease is cured by the way the doctor interacts with the patient. This fits aptly with the behavior of Dr. Joshi.

Day of surgery came and my wife was escorted to the operation theater, papers signed and she was about to enter the operation theater. Just outside the theater was an angel, Dr. Prashisthi. She completely knows her job, knows what the patient and her accompanying husband is undergoing and soothing words that fit into the situation. Her words ""do not worry you are in safe hands under Dr. Joshi"" was calming. The confidence that she exhibited completely took off the stress that I was under.

Though it was a laparoscopic surgery, it would have been converted to open surgery had Dr. Joshi not been there. As per his words to my wife ""you are lucky to not have open surgery."" He later explained that he tried 2 to 3 times to remove the gallbladder laparoscopically but was not able to do so and then thought to give it a last try and it worked due to which open surgery was avoided.

I would suggest any patient with gallbladder removal should consult Dr. Joshi who, in my opinion, is the best surgeon for such surgeries in Fortis Mohali.

After the surgery, I was shown the gallbladder and the stones therein. Dr. Joshi also mentioned that gallbladder is sent for checking if it was cancerous or not and the report came back positive, meaning it was cancerous.

I am really thankful to Dr. Joshi and his whole staff for taking good care of my wife and avoiding a possible dangerous situation had the gallbladder not been removed.

Thanking Dr. Joshi and also Dr. Prashisthi for the comforting words provided just before surgery and even the interaction later on while my wife was recovering after surgery.

Thankyou Fortis for having such a wonderful team."

MouthShut,Fortis,"Healthcare or Money-making machine - Fortis Hospitals.

I would strongly recommend not to go this hospital. Staff here, they don't care about anything. It is not just 1-2 people, the attitude is the same across all levels.
My father was supposed to be shifted from HDU to Ward, it took 8 hours, they said wards are not available, it is not true. It is just that they want to cross the time limit.
Nursing staff is pathetic . they needs to be reminded twice or thrice for the same job.
Though the hospital is congested, admission of patient is purely depends on available of beds not by the health of the patient .
Their Insurance department are not bothered to follow or send the documents or queries back to insurance companies . it is the responsibility of the patient care takers.
I would tell, the lack responsibility, humanity and kindness ."

MouthShut,Fortis,"My wife was admitted on 23rd Jan 2024 bed no.1825 for spine surgery. Surgery was done by a team of surgeons headed by Dr.Vikas Gupte and it was successful. Dr.Sanjay Shah an eminent doctor in general medicine was my doctor under whose supervision my wife was admitted. My wife had earlier undergone two surgeries earlier which were also successful. I appreciate the skill level of the doctors and the infrastructure provided by the hospital. While the hospital charges exorbitant charges they should also give commensurate services.

I have observed the following deficiencies in service.

1. Nursing staff needs basic training in Hindi spoken language. Since the hospital recruits directly from nursing institutes they lack training in behavioral science and should be taught importance of their profession and they should be compassionate towards patients.

2. Team leader Mrs Suvarna acts like a school clerk and doesn't assert herself. She is completely cut off from the main function and acts as if she is not responsible.

3. How to handle emergencies is not taught. They become panic and don't know how to immediately act in a given situation.

4. Importance of timing is not taught. My experience is, if the doctor prescribes medicine at 10 am I get the medicine at 2 pm. Pharmacy and the nurse's dept should work in tandem and be very quick in providing immediate medicine or else golden hours are lost and may be detrimental to patient's health.

5. Lower level staff Mausis or Ayas are a law unto themselves.

If they are called by the patients to clean they think they are obliging by doing that duty. If you press the bell they see it and hide somewhere.

Barring one or two viz. Ashwini and Shraddha who are good at work, others give us lectures and think they are obliging us. Specially Anita Shinde and Haseena are of this category.

My view is for a 45 bed ward, two Ayas are not sufficient. Hospital should provide more Ayas. In a hospital patients' needs are met by not only doctors and nurses but also Ayas or Mausis. They are very important for a patient and they should be available at the patients' beck and call. Here you call hundred times no body attends.

6. No body is accountable. Accountability concept has to be introduced. Everybody should know their responsibility.

These are only few suggestions I have given, Please implement these. It hurts when we pay these high charges it is natural to expect equivalent service.

Last but not the least is this hospital has good infrastructure, very competent doctors and a brand name please don't allow it to be tarnished."
MouthShut,Fortis,"If i would able to give negative stars, I would have given that. Worst hospital in Jaipur. I am doctor and being a doctor i won’t able to save my mother just because of inefficient team of Fortis.I Can assure you will get much better attention and treatment anywhere except here. Don’t go here they are only interested in making a nice medical bill without bothering your critical health. ICU is not having basic equipments, Dialysis machine was not available for my mother as all were occupied to other patients. In 24 hrs time Doctor only visited 3 times to give you sad information only. Worst ICU staff, Junior medical officers only attending critical case, how one can trust them. They are playing with lives of innocent people. God is watching everything if I lost my mother because of your negligence I am dam sure you will also suffer with same pain which I am feeling right now. Hope this review will help you to take wise decision."

MouthShut,Fortis,"I got my mother admitted for knee replacement as referred by Dr. Manjunath during Nov 2023 and got her surgery done. Everything went on smooth but during discharge, this billing team started showing true colors. Billing staff had claimed their maximum around Rs. 3, 38, 759 for one knee and the billing team asked us to pay Rs. 2, 43, 500 post Rs. 85, 000 claimed from insurance company. Since Rs. 2, 43, 500 was way far for me to arrange, we requested doctor recommendation and they gave discount and Siddhu quoted around Rs. 1, 40, 000 and signed to pay to get my mother discharge. I borrowed from several people to pay that hefty amount. Post collecting the money, Sushma - very arrogant lady, rude behavior, having unethical team like her only, instructed her team to charge still and gave me another bill of Rs. 79, 000 to discharge my mother.

First thing, they never explained the estimation post their claim through our insurance company and will keep on giving billing to discharge. Staff started making heated arguments and never gave us discharge summary or instructions post discharge. Since, I couldn't borrow any more money from anybody, I told her I have paid what was instructed and can't pay any more. Later in the evening, we requested doctor to instruct them to leave us since it was already 10:30 pm and we had to travel very far.

Who is responsible for my mother's condition as they didn't give prescription which was supposed to be taken from next day and nor did they advice on physiotherapy. Next day, my mother felt dizzy, luckily, I could contact doctor and took prescription over the phone. Actually, my friend had recommended me that doctor. Later, I got information to visit hospital for bill settlement but Sushma was not available. Another day, I went along with my mother to meet Sushma but again they made us to wait for 1 hour and never came to discuss. Madhu from insurance desk was cribbing that people get discharged and wont respond but was asking me to pay remaining Rs.30, 000, which I denied as I have paid what was instructed.

The inconvenience they caused to us is priceless. Fortis Nagarbhavi is looting people through Sushma and her team even though doctors, nurses, facility, and security staff are doing their duty, which goes unnoticed.

One can imagine how much mental torture this Sushma and her team have given us that even after 1 month I want to give a bad review on them."

Thanks to the entire team of Partani Sir.Dr. Arun Paratani is very good: His experience is very good.

Thank u Fortis ??"
MouthShut,Fortis,Worst and inattentive nursing and admin staff. Very unhygienic rooms. The insurance desk is useless. The discharge summary given by the staff doesn't match with the doctor's prescription. Patient is not been provided with the basic requirements like nursing and food once the discharge process started.
MouthShut,Fortis,"Patient name Vishnu Bapu Patil is admitted in ICU3 Bed Number 1303 in Fortis Health Care, Mulund. A Security Officer Mr Shyam Sundar Nirgun guide us with necessary steps. With his expertise, attentiveness, interpersonal skills, and professionalism, he help maintain a safe and secure environment for everyone.

All the best for his gratitude."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Dr. Ramesh M Punjani operated me for treating inguinal hernia. Doctor was very cooperative and approchable.

Staffs were very cooperative. Got discharged on time with due care."
MouthShut,Fortis,Had very unpleasant experience. They do not care. My dad had to suffer a lot because of there behaviour. Mr Deepak from Urology is very unprofessional and has no respect for human life.
MouthShut,Fortis,"Fortis is not a Hospital, it’s really hospitality centre, where in you get all medical facilities under one roof.

For me since admission to discharge absolutely there was no problem faced at any given time. All the

medical staff including ortho, Cardiac and physicians were really so accomplished with all our quires

and made me to understand the gravity of the situation and a word of praise for their simplicity , which infused with lot of confidence and courage to face the treatment. Apart from this the other nursing , housekeepers, and more important

food department staff were extremely good and courteous."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Dr. Pradip Shah MD associated with Fortis is almost useless and nothing special about him. Dr. Kaushal Mallan ortho is hvng extraordinary attitude shd too limited time, least bothered about his patient's time.

Fortis is more of show business than giving better treatment.

Poor quality staff , only good in billing to the highest. Would not like to give even a single star."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Worst doctor

Ek hi wrist fracture ko do baar oprate kiya or near abt 300000 ka bill banaya ek baar wire dali or dusri baar plate dali uske baad bi wrist ko galat fix kar diya......isse acha too kisi road side malish wale se kaam karwa lena...."

MouthShut,Fortis,"Good experience with fortis hospital, All Staf’s are good in taking care of patients and maintaining hygiene department."
MouthShut,Fortis,"It gives me a mess pleasure to write this testimony of what I have experienced at the Fortis Hospital, Mulund where I have visited with my wife for pregnancy’s procedure. It is our first baby after a long journey of married life. My wife is a patient with chronic Blood pressure and during pregnancy it got worse, she was almost breathless and in additional to this she had severe pain due to swollen Legs.

In Fortis Hospital, firstly we met Dr. Sangeeta Raodeo, Gynecologist who is extremely sympathetic and admirable personality to meet with as she ensured all timely actions to be taken for premature delivery of my wife as a result of it; we have been blessed with a boy baby. Even Nursing Staffs namely Karishma, Nikita etc were prompt in providing all medicine prescription on time for speedy recovery of my wife’s post delivery.

Due to premature delivery, our baby / new one was low weight. Then Dr. Jesal Sheth, Senior Pediatrician, NICU Ward, Fortis Hospital swung into action alongwith her team and took all timely actions / protocols necessary for the well being of our low weight baby. Dr. Jesal Sheth Madam apart from being a Doctor is a charismatic and energetic personality, what sets her apart is not just her technical expertise but also her compassionate approach towards the Infant babies in her NICU Ward. There was also outstanding support given by Nursing Staff and Intern Doctors of NICU Ward, who works under supervision of Dr. Jesal Sheth Madam, to name few Dr. Nafisa, Dr. Megha, Dr. Anjali, Dr. Ana and Nursing Staffs OF NIC to name few Aarefa, Sulakshana, Sandra, Sharin, Karuna, Reshma, Gautami, Manisha, Gayatri, etc., who works under the vigilant supervision of Tito Madam, Head of NICU Ward and least known and vital to say that Cleaning Staffs who ensure a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene condition on the 10th floor, which is especially kept reserved for Pregnant ladies and Infant babies admitted in the Fortis Hospital.

Dr. Jesal Sheth’s counseling sessions were very important to attend as she assisted us in understanding behavior pattern of our baby and clarified several queries therefore; we are and will be in continuous touch with her for our baby's Medical assistance in future.

From the bottom of my heart, I and my wife are thankful to all the Doctors(Dr. Girija Suresh, Dr. Anita Mathew, Dr. Sameer Sadawarte, Dr. Sharang Ravindra Wartikar Dr. Sweta Budyal and Staffs of Fortis Hospital, Mulund, who medically treated and took care of our baby and brought a proud, memorable and auspicious moment in our married life by handing over healthy baby in our empty Hands. God bless all.

The Nursing and supporting staff are very courteous and takes care of all the minute requirements very well.

Would like to thanks Ms. Apurva Kadam, Snehal Madam from TPA Department for being prompt and helping us through all the documentation works in Billing Counter."

Patien is unsatisfied from nursing staff not all some some nursing staff is good. Complain to MOD head but now got proper response. Nursing staff need some proper training. Becz of nursing staff have to extend the hospitalization days ."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Fortis is no doubt a good hospital with good service and medical care with good attitude doctors and nurses... But I cud see a lady reception in the blood test department by name shruthi has lots of attitude , no respectful talk with the patients she is always chatting with her colleague next to her....I guess she shud be given a training first to talk with patients and then make her sit in reception seat...if a person is having a doubt she can't just get irritated at just one go she cud hv explained in a respectful and peaceful manner... I hope fortis administration wil take dis into consideration and ppl like us vil not get come across with such arrogant people"
MouthShut,Fortis,"Only one person in lab billing counter. I could see more than 20 patients are waiting for billing. When they're charging huge amount for medical tests, there should be proper support from hospital. Many Sr citizens and patients are waiting in queue with empty stomach"
MouthShut,Fortis,"I visited today for a consultation to Dr. Rima Choudhari what an excellent doctor with the perfect diagnosis and full of humanity. Dr.Manjeet Singh the one point contact contact help me a very smooth sailing in the hospital.

His staff Akshata so nice to guide me all way through the process of investigations. Leena was so very cordial that I feel all the best of the staff is only at Fortis.

Dr.Manjeet Singh is always readily available for any service to mankind here. Very good and patient delight services available here."
MouthShut,Fortis,The worst hospital ever. They suck your savings like Dracula . Patients are customers for them. My dad was hospitalized because of urine related issues. Doctor Purshottam Puri inserted catheter from his stomach and after few days it was dislocated. He created a bridge between life and death. He was asking that I will do the surgery but I am leaving this hospital in 2 days. I will not be responsible for your surgery. New doctors will take care. He was asking like bhai sahab puncture lgwana h ya nahi ? What the hell. God helped us and he saved us from Fortis Scammers. Dr. Puri is really Unhuman. Very arrogant and don't know how to deal with patients. Please don't go to Fortis hospital Kangra. It's better to go to Govt hospitals rather than this so called fake hospital. Inka bass chale to ye log Murdo ka bhi ilaaj kr de. Inka hospital bs ECHS ki wjh se chl rha h otherwise dispensary b inse achi hain.
MouthShut,Fortis,"1) Two UHIDs created in my case, hence confusions always.

2) Being such a big hospital and to their cost, they won't check if the payment done online or not, they can accept repeated payment if you don't specifically claim it

3) Doctors are good, but never go for scanning at hospital, they don't care if you have taken appointment a month prior and they will make you wait for minimum 2 hours ( even on weekdays) and take walkin patients

4) There is no co ordination between departments

5) Staff's attitude ( Maya from scanning department in gynecology department ) is very bad. They don't want to speak to patients properly."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Very good experience in level 5

particularly Sister Shubhangi has provided very nice experience.

sister Ruth, kamal, sathi, Aruna, priya managed nicely by them."
MouthShut,Fortis,Hospital carrys out unnecessary tests on patients and there is absolutely no coordination between nursing staff doctors and billing.. they make you run from pillar to post even for a cash bill settlement! Avoid this hospital
MouthShut,Fortis,All service are very Poor. Government hospitals provide better service than these. Specialty radiology dept service are too much poor.There is no one to listen to the problems of the patients. Neither any help desk number has been given here.

MouthShut,Fortis,"We had a great care from fortis hospital employees, all the sisters took care of me very well. Good and quick response day as well as night too.

MouthShut,Fortis,"Pathetic Services - I visited Fortis for Surgery of Diabetic foot from Doctor Ravul Jindal. I came here to have a consultation from the doctor further steps for the Diabetic foot surgery. His(Ravul Jindal) Way to talking is not good. It seems like he is in a hurry and didn't connect in a proper manner. He is showing attitude while talking and arguing. I am totally unsatisfied with the services in fortis Hospital. He is charging very high fees for his consultation and didn't have proper time to talk then why you are charging that much OPD Amount if your doctors don't have time to connect. Totally Disappointed.

Doctors should be polite to the peoples to give confidence to patient and their family.

Big Hospital with very bad Services."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I was 34 weeks pregnant and I was consulting from Neeti Kautish. On 24 may I was in labour pain and when I went to hospital they injected me n even not checked sugar also n send back to home. On 27 when I again went to hospital I had ultrasound n they told there is no heartbeat. And they made normal delivery which was impossible if there is no heartbeat. And when my family members told her that you injected steroid earlier and why all this happened when everything was normal.so she said my diabetes shoot high and I was having kidney infection lungs infection And they shifted me to ICU. And at that tym my sugar was 695. Then Anup Gulati had insert drain from kidney that I have kidney infection. And I remain their in hospital for1 week and the total bill was 2.5 lacs. And then when we again went to hospital for removal of drain pipe. he even not came in front of us to even check. I was having high fever at that time. My condition was worst at that time. But his junior doctor told u visit again after having these tests. Than we remove . And at that time we went to sarvoday and and their Dr. Told that this drain was out of that place and the kidney size was too large and the condition was that if again same procedure was not done than kidney should be removed. But he made successful procedure and save my life.

So I request all pls don’t go to fortis . Dr. Neeti and Dr. Anup Gulati are both only money making doctors. They don’t know anything. They even don’t know what they are doing with patients . I lost my 34 weeks baby and also same procedure was done twice due to negligence of urology dr. Worst Doctors."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Visited eye dept, Fortis Faridabad on 12 Aug 2023 after earlier visit of 24 July when I gave a honest feed back . feed back was mainly a suggestion that dr shd listen to the patients medical issues, allergies and the medications being taken . I do not know why Dr Arvind Kumar, eye specialist reacted so badly during my second visit on 12 Aug 2023 where he displayed vindictiveness, harrassment, ignored all medical ethics and made my visit miserable .
vindictiveness and harrassment on 12 Aug 2023.
I got the billing done at 0915 AM, registered with the Coordinator as No 2 on waiting list and told to come at 10.30 AM . at 10.30 AM, I was told to come at 12.00PM and again at 12.00PM told to come at 1.30 PM . all these timings were noted on my bill. all this time Dr was seeing other patients and even at 1.30, I could not consult him . at about 1.40 PM, I was told thta I have come late at 1.40 instead of 1.30 which was really shocking as all the time I was waiting next to the coordinator since 10.30

AM . it transpired that everytime my paper was put up to Dr Arvind Kumar, he recognised my identity who had given a feed back not to his liking and he adopted this unprofessional and crude way of harrassing me .
Aggressive and Crude Treatment.
finally when I met the dr at about 1.50 PM, he taunted me for coming late for review and using medicines without prescription .

I tried to tell him that I am 85 old patient with many medical issues including cancer & could not come due to medical reasons and also I have not used any medicine other than prescribed by him. it is clear he made up his mind to harrass me even before I met him which is not expected out of a dr in a reputed Hospital like Fortis.
He prescribed dilation, FF angiography and trephination at 2.PM . I reminded him that FF Angio was done by him on 24 July and he has recorded it as normal it as normal so why again . he got very angry, mumbled some angry words, gave the papers to my medical attendent .
dr was totally inconsiderate to my medical condition at my age of 85 where I had to be accompanied by a medical assistant to consult him . it was the most painful expereince of vindictiveness, harrassment and inconsideration at the hands of a dr who should have shown some iota of humanity towards a patient , rather than a vengeance for afeed back not to his liking ."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Only high fees charge, keep patients for 2 to 3 hours. Not allowing to carry food by relatives. Only walki talkie security but they do not treat relatives polietly. Third class hospital and security staff. They treat relatives as naukar"
MouthShut,Fortis,"I feel bad to write such a review really. But I am so frustrated today with this hospital. I was here today for my mother's infusion. I had informed dr too last night that I will be here at Bannerghatta hospital at 7am today. It's now 12 noon almost and even the premedication has not started. Dr himself is so frustrated and helpless, almost suggesting us to avoid this hospital for the next session...I hope the concerned authorities see and do something to correct this inefficiency. For five hours, we are just waiting here.... pathetic."
MouthShut,Fortis,Fortis Worst Unhealthy hospital in Kolkata. Hospital has no good facilities and staff behaviour is worst

Thank you fortis hospital and shaym sundar nirgun"
MouthShut,Fortis,"I don't even wish to give a single star. The 1 star I am giving is for the nurses, security and other hospital staff. My father was admitted with brain trauma and was suggested surgery after initial emergency procedures and test. We had informed them about our insurance and opted for cashless service. I was given an approximate rate of Rs. 404000/- for 7 days (Including Surgery, ICU, Medicines, Doctor charge etc.). This amounts to approximately Rs. 58000/- per day. However after 3 days, post surgery and stay in ICU we shifted to different hospital. The final bill given to us was around Rs. 350000/-. They also mentioned a discount of Rs. 26000/- and gave the total bill of Rs. 324000/- which amounts to approximately Rs. 108000/- per day. Almost double the estimation given. I understand that estimation is not the exact amount and there might be slight increase of say 20-25%. Accordingly with this much increase, our bill should have been around Rs. 217500/- (For 3 days with 25% increase in approximate rate) and with discount it should have come down below 2 lakhs. Infact on the day of discharge, in the afternoon we went and verified at the billing counter as to what is the amount till now so that we could arrange the remaining amount other than insurance company pays. She told me the bill was around 232000/-. I repeatedly asked if this has included surgery and other costs. She said yes and the final bill has to include only few small costs (like that day's medicine, doctor charges and other consumables). So we were anticipating a bill of around Rs. 250000/- (which is also not justified as per the estimation given). When questioned about this, the billing manager Sushma was very rude in her behavior and response. She showed us some chart book telling that she has given us discounted price only something blah blah which was not satisfactory. She is so arrogant and impolite with the patient's family. Moreover she doesn't even spare two mins of time to even talk to us properly. We had to wait for more than 2 hours since she was in some meeting. Since we were getting late to shift from this place we were following up with the insurance handling person Mr. Ravindra whether the amount has been approved and released from the insurance company or not. He started yelling on my elderly mother who is already distressed (One due to trauma to her husband, second due to the Huge bill received). So to conclude, I would mention that this hospital is not for common people. They only look forward to loot people as soon as we enter. I have not mentioned anything about the surgery and treatment here which I will discuss in another review.

PLEASE DON'T GO TO THIS HOSPITAL EVEN IF IT'S EMERGENCY. QUICKLY BOOK AN AMBULANCE AND TAKE THE PATIENT TO A CHEAPER HOSPITAL. THE TREATMENT A ND EMDICINE IS SAME EVERYWHERE. AS PER MY EXPERIENCE, THE EXPERTISE YOU GET IS ALSO ALMOST SAME EVERYWHERE."

MouthShut,Fortis,"Worst experience, I have admitted in this Hospital on 16 march 23 due to I met with accident neck injury & teeth Jaw broken, immediately teeth jaw surgery has to be done, but before surgery neurology doctor has to check if any nerve is injured & he has to give approval for teeth jaw broken surgery, I am suffering from severe pain neck and teeth jaw broken more than 18hrs & and my condition was getting very critical nearer to death, but neurology doctor was not available for more than 18 hrs,

Hospital staff they are just saying we are checking, they are not reporting or updating condition of the patient to family members, the plastic surgeon who attended my case he saying to our family members, if our family members are okay he will go head with teeth Jaw broken surgery, how can he take approval from our family members without neurosurgeon approval, so if any challenges if I am going to face in future without neurosurgeon approval who is response and my saturation level was getting down, finally our family members came to know worst service in this Hospital, how plastic surgeon can take approval from our family members did he think our family members are neurosurgeon, hence we shifted to other other Hospital."

MouthShut,Fortis,"I met with a road accident and reached there unconsciously. It was my bad luck when I opened my eyes I was at Fortis Hospital in Emergency. I was in pain and X-rays and MRI was done and was told to go home since no fracture was found...

Since, I was not in a position to move due to severe internal injury, I asked them to admit me which again was a blunder mistake.

They admitted me but extracted as much money they could in all possible ways. They shown No mercy. They did Twice X-Ray was recommended for 3rd,

Twice MRI / EER/ etc.... and ample of tests and multiple times of Doctor visits(charged)... Which Was Not at all required & was just to raise in Bills.

3 days 90k. No treatment, No surgery ! 62k for tests and rest around 30k for Doctor visits and bed charges.

I am Shocked with this attitude of Doctors and medical system approach.

Strangest part they have given me discount too without I have asked???

Will never ever go to this Hospital and would never recommend anyone !!! Really a mess of bad time of my life."

Patient wellfare Department: this is the main department who is taking the feedback & the mediator between the patients and management but the duration of my patient admission to discharge period this department person/ employees are invisible.

I only appreciate to Doctor who is only responsible in my experience."
MouthShut,Fortis,"I came here for a second opinion for my mothers treatment (Lung cancer stage 4). Oncologists junior Dr ( not an oncologist) just scanned the last report and asked for a day care admission with array of tests ( for which i already had the reports in the folder ) . He didnt care to even look at those reports before writing these tests at day care. Didnt understand why they prescribed day care admission when the patient was recovering well and was not complaining any symptoms which required day care. Also for looking at the CDs of scan they asked me another 3500 rs . I have been to numerous good hospitals in last few months and never did i see a Dr. who will charge etc fees for just reviewing your scan CDs seperately) . What is your consultation fees for , if you need extra money for looking at diagnostic reports. I have had experience at Manipal where the most senior onco surgeon reviewed all the CDs plus reports for 2 years with all the patience without any extra buck then his consultation fees.

Glad i was firm on my decision not to get trapped into hospitals tactics."
MouthShut,Fortis,"This hospital has hired a doctor who has greatest degrees however is not a human being. The doctor threatened the patient that he is so powerful that he can take away the patient's job. The patient just asked for recommending some rest as the patient is stressed and even his medical reports indicates physical and mental stress. When the whole world admits that mental stress is a growing problem in the modern world. How can a doctor deny that fact. And how can a doctor say that he can use his connection to influence one's job? Unfortunately I don't have any evidence of this incident, otherwise I would have approach my legal counsel for help."

During this time, there were around 10 relatives of international patients went inside with fruits and flowers(which is again violation as per hospital rules), when I questioned security, she told its the instruction from billing there will be no restrictions to international patients and their relatives. The rules should not be made based on billing , gender, color or nationality."
MouthShut,Fortis,It is so pathetic that even after taking an appointment u have to wait for hours. No one is bothered about the patients time. Its been 5 years visiting to them and the trend continues to be worse. Very Bad experience ??
MouthShut,Fortis,"I am at OPD, waiting a bill to show anesthesia wich is working till 3 pm

.this is been known to us by the cash counter 2 staffs who are keeping us hold since 1.15 pm , i am waiting to pay upon getting boll. Staff has merely prepared 2-3 bills in a hour keeping us waited.and passing time, this is concurrent issue, the manager at 10 th floorr upon knowing that i am there to complaint is seems not intended to meet me, i am still waiting at 10 th floor., If there is any real resolution let manager take immidiate saction failing which this will made a great issue since i have some other urgencies."
MouthShut,Fortis,"Fortis hospital is one of the most unbelievable treatment by the doctors

Well experienced doctors totally the hospital and the staff and sisters good care taker as their own family members., , ??"
MouthShut,Fortis,DR.Swati Mohan and her team are the best LASER DRS . We are very happy and have got me and my two Children LASER WARTS DONE WITH HER.
MouthShut,Fortis,Pathetic. Appointment of dr. Shweta given at 9 o’clock and even at 10 doctor didn’t reach. Their staff talk so pathetically who told u to go to talk to reception. Is it charity hospital where in morning doctor cannot report
MouthShut,Fortis,"It is so strange that the patients are given appointments and the drs and staff dont respect or value the time commitment.. if asked the prompt response is the dr is seing another emergency case... such answers should be investigated...as most of the times its sheer lies. Only covering up the drs delay.

When will the Drs pay attention to their citizen and not their pockets.

With all due respect for their role in the society still they too need an audit"
MouthShut,Fortis,Actually acid reflux ki problem leke gya tha doctor pe...test karwaye... koi major issue ni aaya... medicine dedi total 72 days ki... heavy.. ek problem leke gya 3 problem aur create hogyi mujhe.... worst condition hogyi meri
MouthShut,Fortis,"Recently my elder brother was admitted in Fortis hospital, Bannerghatta, Bangalore for emergency heart strock which was well attended and treated in time due to the very experienced doctors. The treatment was very good and very economic to us.

The staff behaviours are friendly and cooperative in Nature.

The Hospital atmosphere is very neat, clean and hygienic.

We are very scared on the financial part before billing but got relieved after going through the bill. We would like to thank the management of Fortis hospital and Asha madam especially (hospital billing team) who have helped us during this crucial time of ours.

We never expected this type of very good treatment and very economical.

My advise is to consult Dr's here for very genuine consultation / treatment when ever it is possible

JustDial,Fortis,"In aug this year I delivered a cute little boy through C section in this hospital and my experience was very good . Here doctors are so good, well experienced and they are very polite to me. Generally we have this opinion in our mind that govt hospital doesn`t give good service or they doesn`t care about the patients.  But in my opinion  this hospital is good. Doctors like priyanka yadav, neetu, rajesh nd there team is very good.😊😊"

JustDial,Fortis,We came here for two nights as my mother was admitted. The doctors and staff are excellent and my mother recovered after two days.

JustDial,Fortis,"I just visited your hospital and the service is excellent. One of your staffs, Mr. SHUBHAM BANERJEE of Patients Welfare Department is very much coordinating and helped me a lot. Thank you for your help and service at Fortis Vasantkunj and Shubham Banerjee."
JustDial,Fortis,"Though their pathology department is good (of course) but the charges are astronomical. Moreover, the Doctors write all sorts of unnecessary tests and you are left with a feeling of being fleeced. It was good till last year but is becoming more and more commercial. Avoid Fortis for tests."

MouthShut,Max,"I had a really positive experience at Max Hospital. The staff here is extremely professional, caring, and polite. From the reception to the doctors, everyone ensures that patients feel comfortable and well looked after.

The hospital is very clean, well-maintained, and equipped with the latest medical facilities. The doctors take time to explain the treatment clearly and always listen patiently to every concern. The nursing staff is also very attentive and supportive, which makes the recovery process much smoother.

Overall, I truly appreciate the quality of care and hygiene standards maintained by Max Hospital. Highly recommended for anyone looking for trusted and compassionate healthcare services."
MouthShut,Max,"I had a horrifying experience at Max Hospital Vaishali due to poor facilities, operations & management. During my wifes LACS, Dr. Archana (anesthetist) kept struggling for 2030 mins with multiple attempts before another doctor fixed it in 2 mins, leaving my wife in pain for days. Our newborn was kept in NICU for ~8 days only to develop rashes, torn skin & bleeding due to careless nursing. Doctors contradicted each other on discharge just to inflate bills. Nursing staff ignored repeated calls for basic help, and housekeeping was pathetic. Even after complaints to Guest Relations (Mrs. Pooja), improvements lasted only a day. Discharge was full of harassment, valet parking staff was missing, and the food court served stale, overpriced foodeven an expired coconut water pack to my wife. This hospital is a profit-making trap with zero care for patients."

MouthShut,Max,"My experience with Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, during my father's cancer treatment was extremely painful and disappointing. My father was under the care of Dr. Sajan Rajpurohit and his team. When his condition became critical, he was admitted to the ICUa place where every moment counts and where the presence of the primary doctor is crucial.

Shockingly, Dr. Sajan Rajpurohit never visited my father in the ICU. When we asked the hospital staff, they claimed he was not available. However, I personally saw him in the lift at the hospital, which means he was present on the premises but still chose not to visit his critically ill patient. This is not just negligenceit is inhumane.

What is the purpose of admitting a patient to the ICU if the senior doctor doesnt even bother to check on them? Looking at reports and giving instructions from a distance is not medical care. The lack of compassion and seriousness from Dr. Rajpurohit was extremely hurtful during such a critical time.

Even the ICU staff seemed mechanical and indifferent. There was no sense of urgency, no empathyjust routine formalities.

This careless and insensitive approach worsened my father's condition, and unfortunately, we lost him.

I am sharing this review so that others can be aware. If a senior doctor like Dr. Sajan Rajpurohit can neglect a patient in the ICU, it raises serious questions about the hospitals ethics and commitment to life.eply Disappointed with Max Hospital Shalimar Bagh and Dr. Sajan Rajpurohit

MouthShut,Max,"Actually, I should be giving this hospital a no star rating, but the review program is designed so the reviewer is forced to select at least one star. Our experience with the treatment given to my father is totally below the level of medical professionalism. There is total lack of communication with the family members by the staff and the doctors in the MICU.

They order all sort of tests repeatedly and the diagnosis is never revealed. There is never a plan explained by any of the doctors to the family, which is totally unacceptable. All they say to the inquiry by the concerned family is it is in God's hands. They do tests, the diagnosis is never justified, then they order more tests, and continue to keep the family in the dark. They deliberately make delays, which is party of policy without any explanation and continue to rack the bills. The expenses incurred by the family and the suffering of the patient is not in play. So many unnecessary infections were acquired by my father in thev MICU due to the unhygienic practice s. All the doctors have to is hospital acquired infection that cannot be helped.

During the 8-week stay we wanted to move my father out of the Max care, but we were given false promises and sweet talk. I have written a letter to the chairman, yesterday and I really hope he responds. If not well you all know about karma, we go way back, we have become very close friends."
MouthShut,Max,Staff not good. Very rude very unprofessional. No value for patients time. Don’t have sympathetic attitude towards patient family.

MouthShut,Max,"Max hospital Gurgaon MRI not working so patient taken to Modern lab and MRI done of Rs 8500 but hospital Charges ambulance for Rs 4500 .

why ambulance charge recovered from patient when it is fault of Max hopital that MRI machine faulty ?"
MouthShut,Max,"The staff of dialysis centrre in max vaishali are very unprofessional and inexperienced people.Max hospital trains staff for how to loot the money from people if anyone come for treatment they doesn't care about the patients how they feel and are treated such as how they are injected the syringes in dialysis line and Blood pressure is normal or what . They are allowed to new staff on floor without proper training, they are supposed to be stand with new staff and instruct them while injecting the syringe in fitsulla but here is everything Vice versa. Last ti.e shared my incident happened in max hospital, this time same mistake repeated. I can say this sure that they know only ay what time my shift is over and how early will I leave this place... , finally patient and family bears all the cost and all the pains while having the treatment.

Now After closing the fitsulla by which fault... i do not know, god knows finally I bear the neckline for dialysis cost but that was not done superbly, flow was not good , all the day struggled with max treatment"
MouthShut,Max,Worst hospital and worst treatment management.. They have very inexperienced doctors in emergency.. Worst behavior i have ever seen of staff
MouthShut,Max,"I had breakfast at Max .service was very good and staff is very humble and supportive.

Food is very tasty and hygienic"
MouthShut,Max,Doctors are good but no proper management for basic need of the patient. There is shortage of Nursing Staff in the hospital.
MouthShut,Max,Lady doctor in radiology department couldn't make a correct diagnosis of my patient. She couldn't see a foetus in ultrasound while the foetus was clearly visible. There was one yolk sac and in ultrasound she wrote two yolk sacs. She needs to take care of her job as your one wrong diagnosis can push a patient for abortion while there are chances of survival of baby. Max vaishali should check before appointment a doctor atleast in Radiology department.
MouthShut,Max,I write my experience on this platform for max health care hospital this is worst hospital seen in my life his medical services are not good he provide very poor service his general ward not clean well and Medical tests are very expensive doctor write medicine available only his hospital medical store available I am very disappointed and staff behavior very rude not good behavior for Patient and his family members very expensive test and medicine available on his max medical store I not recommended this hospital
MouthShut,Max,"Max Saket is very good hospital having team of experienced doctors. I had my uterine fibriod surgery on sep 24 done by Dr. Vivek Marwah sir. It is very difficult to find such a good doctor as surgeon. His whole team is doing good efforts for recovery of pateints soon. I don't have words to say about treatment and care in max saket. It's very good hospital having team of well experienced doctors.

MouthShut,Max,Very bad experiance in Max vaishali Bed manager are behaving partial & keep you waiting to allot the preferred catagory & after making you wait for almost 24 hours they will say we do not have bed & when you try to check around people who come afterward will be preferred so they act very partially
MouthShut,Max,"Under Dr. Manisha Arora and her team’s brilliant diagnosis, pre and post care treatment and supervision, I would also like to genuinely appreciate the support staff, nurse, attendents, housekeeping etc. who took great care of us. My wife successfully got a major fibroid removal surgery done. While being admitted in max hospital gurgaon B wing for 2-3 days, we got great family like care, emotional and mental support. Although almost of these staff were great, some very special mentions that we would remember forever include Simple & Shelja (nurses) and Shalini & Phool Kumari (support attendants). They were extremely helpful, caring, understanding and cooperative. They did an above and beyond job in helping us navigate such a major vulnerable time. We thank our lucky stars that we got to receive care from them. And of course can’t thank enough in our lifetime to dr manisha Arora and her team. We have found our Gynac for life in her and would always wish that more and more staff in hospitals be like Simple & Shelja (nurses) and Shalini & Phool Kumari (support attendants)!"
MouthShut,Max,"I am writing to express my worst recent experience I had at MAX hospital.

On 9th August, I visited MAX hospital for a routine consultation due to a fever. Without any test results, the doctor claimed that I might have dengue and insisted on admitting me to the emergency department until the reports were available. I was told that if the dengue test was negative, I would be discharged within 24 hours. However, I was admitted without an attendant, and the reports, which were ready by 11 PM on 9th August, were not communicated to me promptly.

From the beginning, I was very clear that I could not afford a large medical bill as I am a student, and my family is not in town. I have corporate insurance, but I was informed that I could not claim it due to not completing six months at my company. Despite this, I was not informed about my insurance status until 10th August.

During my stay, I was not updated about my diagnosis or treatment. On 10th August, around 10 PM, I requested to be discharged as I was feeling fine and was concerned about incurring unnecessary charges. However, the hospital staff was uncooperative, and I felt that I was being billed without receiving proper treatment or information.

Upon discharge, the nursing and billing staff were unsupportive. As a patient on IVs, I had to navigate the hospital alone, which I found to be highly irresponsible and unprofessional behavior.

I am seeking assistance on how to file a grievance and claim compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused by this experience. I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,

MARYAM HUSSAIN"
MouthShut,Max,"Had a very worst experience in max saket hospital my father had gone their for liver transplant , they guaranteed us 100% that his liver will work like a new liver . But they did operation and after operation i lost him. They took payment before operation from us and at last gave us a dead body.I show the father how he got torcher but at that time after operation they give us 0% guarantee .After operation my father got worsted and even he can't talk and walk .Under Subhash Gupta team .They didn't not give any perfect answer.

So, I request you to clear all the things before taking patient there ??

It's better to go ayurvedic even after liver transplantation patient can't survive it's better to go ayurvedic.

One of the no.1money mafia company not hospital"
MouthShut,Max,"One of the worst hospitals in India. They didn't care for their patients properly, which was my personal experience. If any patient wants to go to the toilet, they have to wait 15-20 mins for the nurse to come and help the patient. They weren't changing the bedsheets of their patients even for weeks and we had to request them to change the clothes of our patients.

Due to their negligence, I lost my father. The doctor named Vaibhav Chachra is worse as he doesn't know how to take care of the patients and even how to deal with the family. He was only looking to make money for his hospital and I am sure that he was having his cut in all these. We have spent lakhs of rupeeson the treatment and still, I lost my father. Every day was a trauma for us as Vaibhav was scary every day and every time. Doctor like him needs to learn how to take care of the patients and their families while in treatment and I would suggest he go to a mental hospital.

Doctors and hospitals like him bring a bad reputation, not only to the Uttrakhandbut also to the whole country. So please avoid the hospital and doctors and in the worst case if you have to visit then make sure to take the patient to the other good hospital as soon as possible."
MouthShut,Max,My worst experience with any doctor in my life was with Vikas Gupta. Very arrogant and does not care for time. Comes late and just writes tests
MouthShut,Max,"Deepa Negi, FM attendant was very helpful and cooperative. She was taking all the responsibility to guide the tests to be done. Appreciate her support!"
MouthShut,Max,I was admitted to Max Gurugram on 4 June 2024 with pneumonia and was there till 11 June. I was taken very good care of by Dr. Anish Gupta and his team. He was communicative and was always smiling. The staff when I was in the room was very courteous and efficient. However I had some issues with some assistance I received while in the ICU. I communicated that to Dr. Gupta and he promptly corrected the situation.
MouthShut,Max,The representative didn't have idea about Doctor 's specialisation. I have requested for Orthopaedic and he gave appointment for spine surgeon. I wasted more than 4 hrs in waiting area.
MouthShut,Max,"This boy is so perfect in his work. God bless him. Where nurses are unable to find veins fori insertion of Cannula, there comes this boy ""Vishnu"" and within few seconds he finds the vein and pricks. The Cannula is inserted and he has gone. Superb, keep it up."
MouthShut,Max,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Swasthi from the bottom of my heart on being a great savior for my mother during a difficult phase of our life. My Mother had been detected with Ovarian cancer.

I was totally impressed by the way my mother was treated first time when she met her and the way she followed up. She is not only an excellent doctor , she is simple, superb human being, sober, approachable, smiling face with her selfless service. She is an extraordinary intelligent doctor with human values. Nice advise, hardly find such non commercial doctors in this era. Apart from dedication , she also has slight wit which impresses me more resulting in great relief from stress while chatting with her.

My best compliments for your exceptional care and for making a difference in the lives of others.

MouthShut,Max,"I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a distressing incident that occurred during my father's recent admission to your hospital on April 23rd, 2024. My father, Mr. Prakash Koundal, is a heart patient, and we entrusted his care to your esteemed institution.

On April 24th, 2024, my father underwent a test prescribed by his doctor, accompanied by my mother. Unfortunately, during their visit, my mother, who is not well-educated, approached Dr. Neha Chaudhary on the floor with concerns about the hygiene of the instruments being used. Dr. Neha's response was shockingly unprofessional and utterly unacceptable. She not only yelled at my mother in an aggressive manner but also humiliated her in front of other patients present in the area. Furthermore, she escalated the situation by calling security and forcibly ejecting my mother from the room.

To compound the distress, upon my father's return from the test, he also faced Dr. Neha's inappropriate behavior. Instead of receiving a courteous response, my father was met with further disrespect and aggression. Dr. Neha's conduct towards my elderly parents was not only unprofessional but also deeply upsetting.As per the reports she behaves in the same way with others as well.

Despite our efforts to address the issue with your staff, including raising our concerns with the query desk, the response has been unsatisfactory. While Ms. Nidhi and other senior staff acknowledged the seriousness of the matter, they informed us that Dr. Neha's behavior is considered to be her personality, and therefore, no further action would be taken beyond an apology. As a daughter of Mr parkash koudal i assisted them we just need small sorry from neha to my parents so that they will get out from that feeling not in front of everyone but in person to my parent i didn't ask for the bigger thing but nidhi along with sr dr tried to defend her and said we are saying sorry on behalf of her this is not justice to my parents .

This response is wholly inadequate and fails to address the severity of the situation. It is not a matter of mere inconvenience but one of harassment and mistreatment of patients under your care. My parents, as well as our family, feel deeply distressed by this experience.

I implore you to take immediate and decisive action to address this matter. It is imperative that Dr. Neha Chaudhary be held accountable for her unprofessional conduct and that steps are taken to ensure that such incidents do not recur in the future. My parents, along with other patients, deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, and compassion."
MouthShut,Max,"I recently had the pleasure of being a patient at Max Hospital, From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel welcomed and comfortable. The doctors were highly knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything to me in a way that I could understand. The facilities were clean and modern, and I felt confident in the quality of care I was receiving."
MouthShut,Max,"Everything is ok, service in high level. Staff very polite, doctors very polite and they explain well"
MouthShut,Max,"On 1st April, in the afternoon at about 2:00 PM I went to Urology department. I asked the billing executive to give me appointment of a doctor who is actually available.

After billing I went to the reception of Urology where I was told that Dr Vimal Dassi was in OT. Not knowing when the doctor would return I went back to billing and asked for change of doctor who is available. Billing executive asked to find out which doctor is available.

So, I went back to Urology reception and

asked for alternately available doctor. The receptionist told me that the doctor would be coming soon, so I waited Dr Dassi to return.

Dr Dassi returned after sometime and called me to his office out of turn. He asked me not to sit in chair and keep standing.

He raised his voice angrily talking in a most rash and rude manner as to why I can't wait. His demeanour was that of a school teacher trying to punish his students.

I suggest that a video camera should be installed in Dr Dassi's cabin to record such incidents since he saw me alone.

I intend to take up the matter with Directors / Chairman of Max group of hospitals and also Medical Council of India or similar bodies. If the issue is not addressed properly, I would raise it in social media.

MouthShut,Max,"This is worst hospital. Please do not visit Max hospital Vaishali

I had an emergency few days back, and I rushed to Max hospital vaishali ghaziabad, staff were so rude and they kept me waiting even knowing my emergency condition . After2 hours they ask my father to pay 10k as emergency charges and refuse to give me daily injection because that was prescribed by doc out of Max. my health worsen but they kept forcing us for payment and max consultation . we paid huge money as per their bulshit protocol and finally they only give same injection no other prescription suggested by their so called doc, after harrasing they discharged me in 7 hours.

I will never ever visit MAX"
MouthShut,Max,"My father who is 91 spent 2-3 weeks at Max Gurugram and was taken good care of by the medical team and survived hip surgery and pneumonia and just got home.

He however complained that he was left in a puddle of urine several times whilst in his room which is very unfortunate, especially when recovering from surgery with a big would but even without it is not acceptable for such a big hospital where we paid a 8 lakh bill. They called for the attendants and would have to wait a long time before they came. Hoping this can be addressed not sure who to contact."
MouthShut,Max,"My family had worse experience at max super speciality, saket. so, basically my father was admitted to ICU with chest infection. He was on ventilator for 2 weeks. ICU team and doctors didn't look him well. Infact after 2 weeks his condition was even worse. They provided artificial juices to patient in ICU. They wanted to keep him in ICU for long and charge us lakh daily. Finally we decided to take him out of hospital and bring him home with homecare setup from different health care provider."
MouthShut,Max,"I had an unfortunate experience with this therapist two years ago after watching a live video. Regrettably, my encounter with her was highly unsatisfactory. She presents herself as knowledgeable, but in reality, she turned out to be someone ready to take advantage of vulnerability, making her more of a scam artist than a professional. Punctuality was a consistent issue as she was frequently late for sessions without any prior notice, leading to prolonged delays.

In addition to her lack of professionalism, she exhibited manipulative behavior that negatively influenced my perspective on the world. Her approach involved more threats than guidance, creating an unhealthy environment for communication. Furthermore, she displayed judgmental tendencies, making it difficult for me to open up during sessions.

Rather than providing coping mechanisms for anxiety, her sessions exacerbated my condition, prompting me to seek help from another mental health professional. Overall, my experience with her was detrimental, and I am still in the process of recovering from the negative impact of our interactions. In light of my experience, I cannot recommend her as a trustworthy or right-minded therapist.

I feel compelled to caution individuals against seeking therapy from Ann Simi John, as my personal experience suggests it may not be a valuable investment of time and money.

The video posted above reveals instances of her tardiness during live meetings, which raises concerns about her overall integrity."
MouthShut,Max,"I visited to urology department staff members are so coprative.

Special thanks to Steffy ma'am for your help."
MouthShut,Max,Not good hospital my experience is very bad ?? Doctors not clear about patient and not refer to another hospital. They keep the patient admitted until they kill him. The patient's family keeps hoping that his patient is alive but it is not. This hospital has been made a center of money making. So I request you to go anywhere but not go there ??
MouthShut,Max,"I have recently visited the hospital for a cesarian admission they given me quote of some amount of 1.19 lac+ some 7000 non consumables and after a week their person again sent a new quote which is higher in price aroung 1.32 lac+ some 10k non consumables .

when I ask to to the management for this they said this is our recent prices.

so I would suggest before visit take all tha things in doumentated.

also after visiitng the hospital they treated well for few hour but after admission they are not able provide hospitality to patient because lack of trained staff and their is no quality check.

no soap in bathroom

centralize heater is not working

no bed sheet change

no towel

no quality checks for paitent

no feedback system for imrovement.

Please be aware their management is coming to your windwos every hour for asking about the service but they didint given the good service.

They are doing extortion of money in different way or style.

I would suggest smart hospital is better care the patient.

am helpless becuase my patient is admited.

MouthShut,Max,"We visited max hospital mohali as my mother in law is suffering from rectal cancer. Dr pankaj (radiation oncologist) and Dr sachin ( medical oncologist) gave NACRT. After that Dr. Ritesh pruthy and Dr lovedeep ( surgical oncology team) operated on her. I m lucky that i have chosen max hospital. Doctors are extremely empathetic and made our journey so simple as if nothing has happened. That is the real beauty of their treatment. God forbids if any such thing happens to any family, this is the best place and this is the best team. May god bless them all."

MouthShut,Max,"My experience with the hospital has been amazing. Max, saket has been our go to hospital for many years. My grandmother has her dialysis there thrice a week. The staff and the doctors are amazing. We have also gotten her admitted there quite a few times. The doctors and the staff is trustworthy."
MouthShut,Max,"I'm delighted to write again about a special man that I called ""Superman"". My words are not powerful enough to describe the power of healing that he has within his specialty. Dr. MANNU BATHIA was my mother's surgeon in 2019. He had the challenge of redoing her back surgery which was a reparation for a bad surgery done in 2019 in Cameroon. The surgery was successful.

Today I'm here again to share another special journey with him and his team. 5 years later after my mom's surgery on her back, she trusted Dr. Mannu again and came here for surgery on her knees. At first, she was scared because many hospital policies around the world allow only surgery on one knee at a time. Dr Mannu as usual knew how to comfort her and explained that it would be possible to have both done on the same day. Her second concern was the rehabilitation length of time. Most of the literature we have read confirms that the effective walking process can come after 3 to 6 months. Coming from Africa to a foreign country to stay for an undetermined period can be challenging regarding financial expenses. Dr Mannu one more time comfort her saying that a month of recovery will be enough to stand up and go back to her country safe and on her feet. The surgery on her knees(both) was successfully done on November 14, 2023. There were no complications before during or after the surgery. The hospital team was able to help her stand with a walker 3 days later. Today(November 29), she is at her guest house moving by herself, dancing some mornings, and appreciating her ""18-year-old brand new knees"".

The hospital was so organized, and clean, following all the standard protocols. The staff was dedicated. The price of the surgery was affordable. Dr. Mannu was friendly, hearted, and highly skilled. A special kudo to Mr. Parvaiz who is Dr Mannu's right hand. He went above and beyond with my mother's care from the beginning to the end. I especially recommend Dr. Mannu from Max Hospital to anyone who wants to transform his medical care in India into a wonderful journey filled with Love, care, expertise, and reliability.

Dr Mannu, you are devoted and specialized in what you doing, and what makes the difference is your heart full of compassion and sympathy. My family and I will never forget the impact that you had on my mum's life. You are a precious piece in the extension of her life expectancy. May God bless you and your family indefinitely. You know how to bring back alive any dead bones. As a medical provider, I know what I am talking about and I feel blessed to have such a devoted provider in the medical practice. You did a great job as always. Thank you so much for everything.

MouthShut,Max,"I had a disappointing experience at Max Hospital. It's disheartening when a place meant for care falls short in various aspects, including food service, maintenance, and staff conduct (my husband had a femur surgery and they missed meal in the ICU, not only this he was bought in a broken bed from ICU the room, which we got to know when his epidural got stuck and he screamed out of pain). To discuss these concerns I was introduced to THE GREAT LALITESH SANGWAN, on mentioning that I also come from an hospitality background he called my ex company VANA to enquire about me, he is such a unprofessional, especially discussing me over coffee with someone from your previous workplace, is completely unacceptable. It's fortunate that Sandeep, the Vice President, extended an apology, but the lack of accountability from Dr. Lalitesh Sangwan is concerning. Max Hospital indeed needs to reconsider their leadership selection and prioritise patient care and professionalism. I am curious about Sangwan's inquiries to Vana, warranting a comprehensive explanation and accountability from the hospital's management.

I need to hear from you soon owner of max hospital and have all the proofs (videos, audio’s and pictures) for whatsoever I said in this review.

Thanks, looking forward to hear from you asap"
MouthShut,Max,"My mother was admitted to the Hospital for 4 days. We had a very positive and good experience at the hospital. The staff is very polite, courteous, helpful and caring. The nursing staff in particular are very caring and empathetic. It was a great experience here."
MouthShut,Max,"With reference to the subject cited above, I would like to bring your notice to the insupportable behavior of the doctors in Max Hospital, Mohali.

I would like to inform you that my father has been taking kidney treatment from Dr. Manish Kumar Singla, Max Hospital Mohali

A week ago , my father encountered pleural effusion, and he was facing a lot of breathing and cough problems. So, we decided to visit Max Hospital, Mohali, which is identified as a great chain in the medical sector, and it is 250km away from our hometown. On 30th October, we paid opd to meet Dr. Manish Singla. To our surprise, he didn't do anything, just referred to chest specialist Dr. Deepak Bhasin. To meet him, we again paid the opd charges. Ironically, instead of doing the process of pleural effusion removal, the doctor took just a sample of fluid by painful injection and prescribed some tests worth Rs. 12000, which turns out to be all negative. These 3 days until we got reports were just waiting period in pain without getting any treatment or prescription

On 2nd November, after getting the reports, when we visited again there. We faced harassment as we had to wait for 2 and half hours, which is like one has to do in any government hospital. Honestly, this is a black spot on the brand image of Max Hospital. After waiting a long. We paid other opd charges, and upon our request, they did the process of pleural effusion removal. It cost 6100 for the process coupled with 2200 for consumables.

Despite paying a lot of money and investing long time. The doctors were supposed to prescribe some post process consequences like fever or so. But they didn't tell anything even if they didn't give any antibiotics to cure the effects.

Last night, my father was suffering from severe fever, and we were not aware of what to do. This morning, when I approached the assigned doctors, they didn't pick up the call and messaged back to call at 3 p.m., which is really an unpleasant experience. At the given time when we contacted. His attendent told me that the doctor would call you back. Till 5 pm, we didn't receive any call. Such negligence can lead to severe problems. On being enquired, these problems are usual here."
MouthShut,Max,"Had the worst experience with Max personnels at Saket. It was around 5 pm when I had gone for lab draw and before filling out the registration form, I confirmed with the front desk that if it's possible to get the reports same day as I had to see my private doctor next day at 9:30 am. She confirmed that physical report is not possible but I would get the report in my email by end of the day and I can use it for my doctor's appointment.

I again confirmed with the guy who drew the blood and was given the same assurance that although physical report is not possible, I would get the details in my email that same day.

Never received the email that day. Waited till 9:30 am next day, no email. Tried calling, no answer. By this time, had to cancel doctor's appointment and couldn't reschedule because I had to fly back next day.

I finally went to Max requesting a refund which was denied by front desk and referred to the Manager on Duty, Prakash Kumar Singh. The most arrogant, disgusting and disrespectful guy I have ever met. Instead of listening and trying to understand, he accused me with ""how do we believe you didn't get the email"". I offered to show my inbox and his response ""well you could have deleted it"". I offered to share my Deleted folder and his final accusation that so deleted the email from the Deleted folder!!

On top of that, he looked at the doctor's order and gave his so-called diagnosis that I am creating a fuss as the tests do not show I have any chronic issue so I shouldn't worry that much!! I asked him is he a medical professional to diagnose and he used his experience working in medical field. He then called his supervisor Mr Ajay Kumar who was very understanding and talked in a much calmer tone but Mr Prakash would override whatever his supervisor would say.

Nothing got resolved with all this chaos!! They kept saying I can have my reports and my argument was these reports are no good to me as it was not delivered in timely manner as promised by Max personnels. They reached out to GM Mr Sachin Srinivasan who agreed to give 25% refund which I was not ready to accept. Mr Arun Kumar assured me he will work on the issue on Monday and would update me but no phone call or email from him. I called him on Monday and was told to give him 24 hrs which again was useless as he didn't pick the phone after that.

I have the proof of the employee who registered me on the receipt and the signature of the person who drew my blood. I told them to contact both employees and confirm I am telling the truth but they didn't care to double check the facts.

Overall, it was a headache to deal with this much of unprofessionalism and disrespect of Mr Prakash and Max as a whole entity. I know they will still get patients and clients everyday but I will make sure to share my experience with all my friends in US and also ensure they avoid this facility.

Shame on the administration to not consider a request for Rs 2100 and shame on having employees like Mr Prakash who lacks basic courtesy and customer service skills."
MouthShut,Max,"Excellent staff, was taken care properly. Doctors and nurses are very helpful. Overall, great experience."
MouthShut,Max,"One of the worst hospital in Dehradun with Doctors having no experience or with fake degress, doctor with name ""Amnrish "" is a classis example .

If you have money and don't want patent to be treated well, go and get him admitted in this else there is no point in vistiing Max"
MouthShut,Max,"Doctors are really good in Max hospital, but the rooms are below average, beds and mattresses are so bad that the patient can develop severe back pain. I experienced it at the time of 2nd covid wave. I couldn't sleep on the bed. It was a torture. And recently when my daughter delivered her child, she was in extreme discomfort. Nursing staff is a mix of good and bad, under trained too."
MouthShut,Max,Room no 2599- i was very anixious earlier bt here vevery one ia very co operative n helpful even the doctors are very good . I would highly recommend people .
MouthShut,Max,Have started my mothers treatment with Dr Nagender Sharma (oncologist)and am extremely satisfied with his expertise and most importantly his patience and way of treating his patient. Even being busy is readily available personally if any problem to be discussed. Thanks to his coordinator as well Mr Manish...for making things so easy for us and going out of way to help us in other departments also.
MouthShut,Max,"We went to this hosp in an emergency for my Mother’s treatment . She was was admitted after lengthy , cumbersome and time consuming procedures at the Emergency reception . The dealing Lady doctor was arrongant and rude in her behaviour with us. After two hrs of waiting, my mother was admitted in the CCU….we thought everything would be fine hereafter.., but the reverse was the truth. The doctor on duty just took half a minute to glance through the case file… did not even checked the patient … did not even speak to the patient and ordered Cardiac procedure to commence from next day. The CCU looked like a busy Railway Station … too noisy n crowded… nurses n staff talking continuously at top off their voice. The lenin, clothing and other essentials provided to the patient were third grade … patient was even not allowed to use the wash room…

this n much more my Mom suffered in her critical health condition… and she decided to leave the hosp irrespective of the consequences. We took the patient back due to extremely poor services at Max Hosp Dehradun.

We will never visit this hosp again… !!!

Go on your own risk!!"
MouthShut,Max,Max hosting has taken a patient of our family on 19.9.23 from day to night but after that they have leave the patient without any reason at night he has heart problem at night the patient has heart problem till now .My point is that why the has leave the patient at to night where the patient family members take him to which hospital and why they has take the patient
MouthShut,Max,"I really very happy with the attitude of nursing staff. They are really very trained and helpful. They were available at first call. I really thank madam shallu, madam balbir, madam sunita and madam harsh. Really very supporting and efficient staff. I thank then all. Thanks to knowledgeable doctors team also..."
MouthShut,Max,"My Father's life was taken by the Dr. Sunil Dhar team of Max Hospital Vaishali Ghaziabad due to their negligence.

He was a fit man not having any kind of illnesses. He was admitted to Max Hospital, Vaishali, Ghaziabad for gallbladder surgery on 15th August 2023. Before starting of operation the Dr. Devesh Loshali from the team of Dr Sunil Dhar has given the wrong/high dose of anesthesia and due to which my father collapsed on the bed. In order to save themselves from legal consequences they dumped my father's body on everytime ventilator, although he has already died. They kept my father's body for three days at every time they narrate diffrent stories about my father health condition. They finally declared my father dead after preparing a different story on the night of 17th July 2023, so that nobody can hear the pain of us in the hospital which may ruin the hospital image. The death of my father was not only medical negligence but murder as the doctors knew very well that non-augmenting of measures which may occur during anesthesia which may lead to death were not available to the hospital clearly shows murder."
MouthShut,Max,"They won't treat you first but will make bills more than 25k even you enter the hospital. In my case I got admitted in emergency ward but they themselves make it stay of 3 days on paper.. I was there for abdominal pain.. they gave me no

medicine and keep me waiting whole the day

and in the evening they took samples and forced

me to shift in the ward which was not necessary

in my case. And when I opposed to stay in the hospital they tried convincing me and made bil of 32 thousand just for 6 hours stay on emergency bed with few tests done. Pathetic service. They didn't even provide me prescription and lab reports. They just want to cut your pocket"
MouthShut,Max,"I strongly advise against choosing Max Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, for preventive health checkups. My personal experience with their highest package, Titanium, was terrible. Despite paying a significant amount, they didn't perform essential tests like X-ray, Pap smear, and dental and eye checkups. Furthermore, they didn't provide all the necessary reports and doctor consultations, causing immense frustration and wasted time. They even misplaced my stool sample, making me redo the test. The hospital's inefficiency and lack of accountability led to a highly unsatisfactory experience, lasting for five months and counting. I urge anyone considering this hospital to be cautious and explore other options."
MouthShut,Max,"I am Praveen pal and Suffering from colon cancer. I am getting treatment by dr.

And His coordinator Sneha Mam is also very good in behaviour and Nature.

Whenever we want to ask them something they pic up the call and gives answer in very politely even on holidays.

God bless them a very healthy life."
MouthShut,Max,"I visited this hospital a few times with my mother who was undergoing radiotherapy. Very good doctors Dr Garg and Dr Priyadarshini in particular but waiting rooms crowded with no facilities for terminally ill patients and cancer patients.

The hospital is located in the filthiest area of Delhi with garbage depots outside with cows dogs and crows eating at any pickings. This very rich profiteering hospital should invest in the surroundings too. The Aam Admi party will do nothing. True 3rd world setting"
MouthShut,Max,"Brilliant hospital

MouthShut,Max,"Hi,

My mother's treatment is going on under Dr. Meenu Walia mam and we are satisfied with the treatment and the whole team of Mam is doing well. If we talk about admission procedure then my suggestion is that there should be a some easy procedure so that patient do not have to wait for a long time. Nursing staff is Good.

Mr. Shubham Singh at the

Front office is very helpful and of a supportive nature.

I would like to suggest that management should pay some more attention regarding the shortage of staff especially GDA staff and also the necessary items such as Blood Box and Nebulization machine as it is short as per my experience.

Thanks"

Doctors, nurse, staff all are just animals. They want money even from a dead body. I told them that I am aware that my father is dead, so please give me the body.... They straight forward denied that no we are putting him on ventilator and giving him blood also.they even say that we don't have ambulance for your patient...you have to arrange by your own. Me and mother have no other person there ..and my father was on ventilator......and they are just playing with us. They give me a bill where they mention that in 1 day they have given 32 units of blood to my father... Is that practically possible for a body to have 32 unit of blood in one day.... They are real monsters..... please I beg to everyone..... don't take your near and dear ones to this hospital if you want to see them alive"
MouthShut,Max,I obsereved Doctors & surgeons are not so qualified. In them I found lack of huminity. They are only professional & how to earn money.They do not have kindness towards a human who is facing acute. In future they may be in hopeless condition. Overall huminity first is absence. Such thought should come from their eternal heart. Hai paisa is the funda of most Doctors. Overall I am.not satisfied. I wanted to rate but due to compulsion I am rating three.

Dr.Subash Gupta and Dr. Shalin and teams.

The staff behaviour is really impressive especially ""Dr. Vikram and Dr. vipul"". Both are so polite and caring in nature , and ICU staff all nurses and Doctor D.J. are excellent and dedicated .

I am highly thankful to the staff and nurses 4th floor ward : Arshi, Reema, Kirti, Anjitha, arut, sekib, puroshtam, wouchan, sumet and Deepak and all of there with GD staff.

And from the side of Housekeeping : Suman and another member, they are much taken of my baby care.

Thankyou Max

Must opt for Max hospital."
MouthShut,Max,You take an appointment and when you arrive they just tell you the doctor cannot see you right now. No apology for not able to see. No reason provided nor any empathy for the patient.

MouthShut,Max,Couple of days ago i admitted my mother for bypass surgery. Ctvs ICU Worst nursing staff. Worst food provided to patient. Totally disappointed by MAX hospital facilities. I was called at 11pm for arranging blood platlets so that hospital can operate in morning.

MouthShut,Max,"Worst. You will waste your money. They are only here to mint money. There are huge price difference if you get chemo from Shalimar bagh it will cost only 21k but here they charge more than 28k and they do not ahve ambulance or emergency care service for any query they will send you to go Max Saket. The management, nurses are alwys talking then actually working. Do not go there as a small unit they only think about profit to survive. Doctor Jhulka is good but most of the time he own't even remember you name forget about case, nurses are always hurry to go home early. On duty doctor won't even take your call."
MouthShut,Max,"Its money minting press and they have perfect recipe for manking good balance sheet you can have good case study of gr8 business . There lack of coordination among staff and departments you have to bridge this gap if you want to get treated. They help you to come closer with your patient both physically and emotionally because after all you are the only responsible for all his/ her needs in hospital. Surprise are part of your stay you will get used too soon.

At last you will realize chal aa hi gaaye hai to krwa leta hu. And for 100 times and to 100 different people staff you have to tell them why you are here because padne mei time aur mehnat dono lagta hai puchne mei nahi."

They just seem interested in taking as much money from people as possible. A total waste of time!

MouthShut,Max,"This is the worst hospital and dark patch in the name of Max brand. The top management must review the team of doctors who behave like jhola chaap doctors aiming to plundering only. They do not have practical knowledge of medical treatment. It seems that management has filled up the vacancies with russian/Ukrainian/donation degree/reservation category doctors.

Few days back we did biggest mistake of our life when we admitted our father through emergency due to respiratory issues under Dr. Mayank, Pulmonologist. Around 04:00 AM we visited there for first aid only while for hospitalisation we always prefer BLK for last 10 years. But doctor in emergency convinced us it was a normal infection which would fixed in a couple of days so admission was required. But our decision turned into a big mistake.

Around 11:00 AM they shifted him in MICU from emergency in pretext of precautionary basis while we requested them to shift him in a normal room because his SPO2 level using oxygen mask had reached at 92, while initially it was 88. The whole day he was normal in MICU. Around 11:00 PM we spoke to the ICU staff through intercom who informed us that he was completely normal. But around 11:30 PM I received a call from MICU that his situation had become worsen so they were planning for the ventilator.

I shocked to hear it as he was normal the whole day till 11:00 PM, so I disagreed about the usage of ventilator, but ICU incharge warned me for its negative consequences, then finding no other way I express my permission for fulfilling her wish. After 36 hrs usage of ventilator they switched to NIV support then on Bipap, again NIV, again Bipap, which turned our father into a most critical situation. We understood that it had become worst period of our life.

On fourth day during visiting hour I put off Bipap mask for trying to talk with my father but I really shocked to see that his mouth including tongue had full of fungal infection. I cried about such neglegence where basic hygiene had not been maintained which created high infection. Initially, TLC was 7000 which hiked above 15k. When discussed the situation with Dr. Mayank who was blank mind with dead end and no idea for further treatment. He advised us to wait and watch because he could not able to change the antibiotics, neither he could able to make bronchoscopy. He also informed us for usage of ventilator again as his situation was deteriorating. He told us that in such a situation he generally advise to the attandants for taking back their patients at home for Sewa.

Then we shocked and decided that we should immediately shift our father into BLK hospital by any means. Then we discussed the matter with our primary doctors of BLK who agreed to take charge of him, if we could able to shift him from there as in transit risk was severe. But we had no other option so decided to took risk, which was successful. Here at BLK we always feel that doctors are replica of Bhagwan. They never left no stone unturned for the betterment of their patients. Dr. Subhash Chandra, Dr. Atul prashad, Dr. Vineet Banga, Dr. Narryar are remarkable doctors who changed the complete picture and provide us the desired results. Now our father is stable and shifted into pvt. room who is recovering very fast. Thanks to BLK, our trusted hospital ever.

This is not only our story in MAX Vaishali but there are a lot of similar stories where most of the time people lost their family members as such dare of shifting cannot take everyone.

I have no other word to say them criminals, plunderers and murderers instead of doctors in Max Vaishali.

I urge the top management of Max to thoroughly investigate such malpractice as unprofessional doctors are diminishing the brand name of Max.

I also request Medical council of India to investigate about such malpractice where people are being plundered with many lakhs of hard-earned money including the loss of life of their family members."
MouthShut,Max,"They murdered my father. The ICU doctors Mohit Mathur, Monica Gupta and Swapnil are cold, rude and don't care for the patients. On his 2nd day in the hospital (he was in the HDU

at this point), my father complained that

the med/nursing staffer named Nagender, pushed him and forcibly held him down. Horrible!

My father walked into the hospital with a mild congestion ( no fever, no cold, covid negative and excellent blood-work) but was over-sedated by these monsters who also wanted put him through unnecessary heart surgery despite the fact that he developed fever on the 3rd day..thanks to abysmal hygiene standard. Saw him lying in his excrement on 2 different occasions. But instead of cleaning him, they had thrown 3 blankets and a sheet over him (he had 102° fever by then and they should have given him cold packs instead). The nursing staff is equally awful and uncaring. Also, we found injuries in his face, a bad one on his nose on the 4 the day. He was comatose at this point.

The Alpha beds don't function (have 'out if order' stickers) despite the fact that they charge 1-1.5 lakh rupees per day (non surgical).

We lost him on the 10th of January to the greed of these soul-less criminals. Reason of death they wrote was 'sepsis'..developed due to the gutter-like hygiene they maintain."
MouthShut,Max,Caught them overcharging. Nobody responded for 2 day . Couldn't explain and kept on giving excuse that hospital software work like this only.
MouthShut,Max,"Zero empathy and care for patients. They only care about high value billing. Refused to see senior citizen as it was a walk-in.

All doctors including Dr Dang who had zero waiting time refused. We had to threaten to file a complaint when the emergency dr agreed to see.

It’s time they shut this hospital and open a low grade departmental store given the way they treat their patients"
MouthShut,Max,"All the hospitality is geart and coprative

Meal for patient is nice and hygienic.

Security staff is nice and obident."
MouthShut,Max,"ICU incharge Divya Jyotiand Doctor Subhash Gupta , shalin Aggarwal are not doctors but they are here only to collect revenue for hospital.all are looters and criminals.national medical council should take some strict action against such criminals so that nobody may loose his/ her near and dear ones. All these doctors have murdered my mother.ICU incharge Divya Jyoti is misusing ventilator and all other medical equipments.He makes attendants fool by laying dead patients on ventilator.also he informs about death in late night so that nobody can listen raised voice of family members of murdered patients.Nursing staff of ICU 4th floor is so cruel. I request all the viewers to share all this more and more on social mediaso that nobody may loose his/her near and dear ones. How my mother is murdered by Dr.subhash Gupta is explained below by my brother Neeraja garg."
MouthShut,Max,"Very bad experience.
Morning if you call customer care to get appointment, they does not pick call and if picked you will be in queue for 30 min and the it disconnects.
I do billing for urology doctor and since doctor was busy in operation I kep waiting for 2 hour and then asked for refund but they did not refund, instead doctor assistant asked to get ultrasound done with saperate billing, i got it done, but doctor still not came so she write few medicine.
I asked for refund of doctors consultation. Assistant said I did consultation on doctprs behalf. Andcthey have not refund the money.
Now looks like in max hospital mohali, doctor and assistant doing same work and charge same fees .

They are cutting patients pocket. I never recommend to go to this hospital."
MouthShut,Max,Services are pathetic in NICU. They are literally not paying attention at all. They are literally killing babies by not providing nutrient diet. So that they can nake baby more sick to extract money
MouthShut,Max,"Name - Kanta Garg

Max ID - MHLI 289312

Doctors - dr. Subhash Gupta, Dr. Shaleen Agarwal and Team

Hospital - Max Super Speciality Hospital Saket

Address - 4th Floor ICU West Block and 5th Floor Economical Ward

I am very sad to inform my mother declared dead by Max Super Speciality Hospital Saket on 15th Nov 2022.

My mother admitted to Max Saket on 30th August 2022 for minor surgeries of Parastomal hernia and cholecystectomy(Gallbladder Removal). She came to hospital on foot and travelled all the way from train up to New Delhi and was in good condition and her all parameters were normal.

Due to surgical Blunders her small intestine cut down during first two surgeries by Max Healthcare on 31st Aug 2022. But no one from medical team or surgery team informed us. After operations her condition started to deteriorate and her oxygen level, BP dropped drastically. Doctor informed us that this is nothing to worry and she will be normal in 1-2 days. But after seeing no improvement they admitted my mother to ICU.

On 4th Sep 2022, Doctors shifted my mother to operation room without consent of family and patient. We were surprised and shocked when we came to know that her third surgery started without our consent and without discussing with us the reason of third surgery. But with no alternate we have to sign paper later on for well being of my mother.

After operation doctor informed us they have removed 1 feet small intestine due to infection. We were surprised and shocked and we asked doctor how small intestine get infected. But we did not get any proper response. Doctor hide the reason behind this. Doctor put pasting to connect cutting edges of small intestine. Doctor told us we have to wait for 7 - 8 days to see if pasting will hold or not.

After 4th September, My mother was on ventilator up to 6th October 2022 and her condition was critical and survival chances were quite low. As a family we prayed day and night for her survival. She suffered unbearable pain on each day of her stay in hospital due to surgical blunders. She was unconscious for many days after third surgery and was on continuous ventilator and many other machines support. Approx. 12th Sep 2022, pasting did not hold and large wound get opened in her stomach as attached in photos. She started to feel unbearable pain on stomach area due to large open wounds. Whatever she eat, around 80 to 90% get leaked from stomach large wound and that is quite horrible to see such situation of my mother.

Doctor told us her large wound may recover with food and diet. ICU staff and nurses were not cooperative and seems quite rude to patient and patient family request. ICU staff were not serving her proper food and she was not able to speak due to tracheostomy tube and ICU staff seems to be taking advantage of that limitations.

She started to get some strength in hand after few days and started writing to us about ICU staff behaviour and rudeness when we visit to her during ICU visiting hours. We have complained same to ICU In Charge Doctor Dibyajyoti but he seems to taken it lightly and no proper care was provided after multiple verbal complaints.

My mother and whole family was distressed after seeing lack of care in Max Health care ICU and same I have reported in max healthcare feedback forms.

We are shocked to see only one Wound care Nurse was available in Max Health care Saket and she was unavailable most of times due to leaves and holidays and unavailability. Due to large wound my mother dresses with wound bag and that works for hardly 2-3 days and get leaked very soon. If leakage not controlled then it will cause severe infection to patients with fever, shivering and skin infections. Most of times her bag replacement delayed by 2 to 3 days due to lack of wound care bag replacement staff. That cause my mother condition further worsens due to fever and infections. We informed same to hospital and Dr. Subhash Gupta many times but no adequate steps taken to address the issue.

No adequate steps taken by ICU staff to address issues and my mother clothes, skin get wet with leakage coming out of side and many times she got infected with fever and serious infections and that also delayed wound healing process

My mother got weakens with each passing day and wound seems to be not healing but doctor keep saying it will recover over the time. She keeps suffering unbearable pain with lack of services.

We keep asking hospital why her small intestine get cut down . Kindly give us suitable reason as there were no issue with small intestine and purpose of admission was other minor surgeries.

They are not able to answer and just keep saying your mother will be recover soon.

Later on Dr, Subhash Gupta admitted small intestine cut down due to surgical blunders during first two surgeries on 31st Aug 2022. We were shocked to hear this.

Finally after suffering for 76 days, Doctor decided to do fourth surgery on 14th Nov 2022. After surgery, bleeding continue and she was unconscious. She died on 15th Nov 2022 and all her unbearable pain also disappear. Family is in tears and mentally shocked and feeling guilty why we admitted my mother to Max Hospital Saket.

She want to live and see her grandsons, granddaughters growing up but surgical blunders and lack of proper nursing services at Max Saket taken away her life.

Hospital charge around 1 lakh per day for stay in ICU and services were quite poor as we experienced on each day and caused worsens my mother conditions.

Initial estimate was 2.25 lakh and final bill was more than 40 lakh+

Total Bill was in excess of 40 lakhs+ we have spent around 4-5 lakhs on stay and meals etc. at New Delhi+ Around medicines and wound bag of 2 lakh we have managed ourselves.

We have requested many times to hospital and max health care Chairman to provide us justice but they are not able to provide any proper response and just rubbing there hands off from all the surgical blunders and poor nursing services.

With fighting spirit my mother survived for 76 days but at end she left us after bearing unbearable pain and her cries in pain keeps coming in our memories.

My Father is 72 years old and suffered a lot and relentlessly served my mother in hospital day and night. Due to lack of services my father use to clean her wound bag many times in fear of bag will get leak and my mother will get infected.

My father is shocked and depressed and lost his hard earned money and also dignity to live life proudly with my mother.

Now for day to day work he has dependency on others to help him.

I have attached few photos of my mother so that everyone can get feel of pain she had gone through for 76 days.

Kindly help us in providing justice to Family.

MouthShut,Max,"We are living the worst nightmare with Max hospital Vaishali.

The nightmare started with the entry into the hospital. The sequence was as follows:

1. We brought our 6 years old daughter (Prisha Sharma) to emergency after she was unconscious at home in the morning. She also had cough and cold.

2. 5-6 different doctors approached us between 7.30 am to 11.00 am but no one could decide because they all were waiting for the neuro surgeon's opinion and also suggested congestion in chest. Till 11 am no opinion was made and everyone was giving different options for the admission in the hospital rather giving us the line of treatment for our daughter, finally, we decided to take discharge.

3. At the time of discharge we found that hospital claimed visit of pediatrician but no one suggested treatment for chest congestion, I doubt they were actually pediatrician!!!!

4. We gave our feedback at the time of discharge, post which admin Department had detailed discussion with us and called Sr. doctors Ms. Shweta and Dr. Ramalingam. After their intervention and much consultation, we decided to admit our daughter.

5. The experience with Dr. Ramalingam was so satisfying that we forgot everything but then .. again ..

My daughter was taken for CT scan by the attendant and she left her out side, there was no one to attend her!!

7. We were given containers for urine sample collection around 4.30-5.00 pm, and at 6.00 pm we advised staff on duty to collect it and reminders were given. Last reminder was by a 6 years old i.e my daughter herself at around 9.00-9.30 pm, staff came and assured us to collect it.

8. Meanwhile, we were requested to shift from room 3301 to 3309, after shifting, we cross checked at 10.45 pm and to our surprise, the staff on duty was clueless...about the urine samples.!!!

9. Sample was taken again at 11.25 pm.. There are other small issues such as Dietician and pentry services... Hospital claims that dietician will plan but again a big disappointment ....the point which I want to make here is that each one of us are charged individually but the treatment will be similar to the entire section here....

Don't know how many such events are yet to be faced !!

I want to ask, why can't we go to the best doctor directly to take their opinion and provide care at home with extensive follow-up. However best hospital care like Max Hospital is thought to understand and provide timely and quality care to its patients, but the fact is far far away from our understanding, We had to follow everyone from pillar to post to do the job.. Is it worth spending so much money and energy here... Not satisfied at all with this unethical behavior."
MouthShut,Max,"Very bad and sad to write that my mother is having treatment of cancer from february 2022 of stage 4 patient by doctor meenu walia and teem very well and recover 75% in utrous caner and finally told to frsh review.after ct scan in IPD

She told to do now as Normal operation and we admitted and finally operation successful but bp low and heart failafter operation. And in emergency doctor told me not to operate such a patient of 35% heart working.Whysenior doctor advice to operate this ??

MouthShut,Max,"Please be aware of Max Saket Delhi especially international patients. They used my baby as a target. They never follow protocols or guidelines Dr Neeraj tried to closed a large VSD for my 5 month old child with a device and put him under cardiac arrest and damaged his brain he mentioned he is an ideal candidate for device closure. While other Drs are saying my child was too small for a large VSD device closure. Thereafter, Dr Dagar did an open heart surgery instead of closing the VSD he made my child's right ventricle small and again Dr Neeraj Awasthy never mentioned this to us. They produced false echo reports to us. We later found this out from another Dr outside of MAX. When when we approached Dr Dagar he denied it. Dr Neeraj Awasthy and Dr Dagar even called the other Drs to find out what information was given to us. I still can't understand why Max will still keep dishonest Drs like Dr Dagar and DR Neeraj. We now have all the evidence to proof that these Drs was in the wrong from our experience. Never trust Max Pediatric Cardiology."

MouthShut,Max,"My experience with Max vaishali was worse, they are doing a business with no empathy. The nusrsing staff is total useless, you ring the bell then go personally to call them but they will come only if they feel like coming. Top of all they have so many hidden charges, so you end up paying a heavy amount even after having the best of insurance plan. Never go there. fortis noida is no far better, way way better"

Availability of staffs @24×7 was there...

Sanitation to medical care facilities all are well being.specialized doctors with their cooperation and infrastructure was very nice."
MouthShut,Max,"5 minutes agoNEW

We want to quote and instance regarding best of the service offered by Dr Saurabh Lall from Max Saket. Where he is more curious and worried about knowing the details how we found his contact no rather than willing to know about the concern what we called for. He didn't even bothered to listen the reason behind call and was more interested in informing that"" I am senior person and you cannot call me"" these kind of Doctors are the only one who really spoils the image of the whole organization. Our concern was only to request his intervention in fasten up the process of cashless request pending from last one week."
MouthShut,Max,"My father was admitted for 10 days and that the doctors gave the treatment was very good, and the doctors were also very good and the staff and security here were also very good."
MouthShut,Max,"I admitted for the small procedure but the charges were high. However, the treatment was okay and done by the dr deepa."
MouthShut,Max,"Worst and most expensive services… they got my father in law admitted and after 1 day we got bill of 65k… unnecessary charges…for normal blood test like CBC, CRP which cost 250-300 Rs outside they have charged 3 times… for doctor visit of 1 minute they have chaged 1400 twice a day… just full fledge loot nothing else"
MouthShut,Max,"Awful experience. Everyone is working as money making machines. Staff is inhuman. Nurses are busy in data entry and making reports and patient is dependent on its attendant only for care. Nobody comes for drip change, multiple reminders required for giving medicine to patient. Even measuring temperature is attendant job. Doctor on rounds are visiting like a Lala for one minute and their visit is charged Rs 1200 per visit. For less than 2 days , they have charged us Rs 50 k for gastro infection."
MouthShut,Max,"Dr. Neeraj Awasthy pediatric cardiologist has lied to me that my baby is and ideal candidate for a VSD device closure. When he knew that my Child had a large Apical Muscular VSD which can not be closed with a device which I recently found out he however forced us into this procedure, yet we asked him for the safe option which was the open heart. We when ahead making us believe that the process is safe he mentioned he did this for other kids. Little did we know that he was experimenting on my child to enhance is portfolio. He put my little child under cardiac arrest and brain damaged him. He has no love for kids he was very cruel to my child. Never trust Dr. Neeraj Awasthy."
MouthShut,Max,"Worst and farzi hospital. Money minded hospital. They will charge you hell lot of money and will give you wrong report and if you will tell them about this they will get angry . DO NOT TRUST MAX VAISHALI ...THEY ARE BIG TIME cheaters

IF YOU WILL GO TO ANY STAFF FOR HELP THEY WILL JUST IGNORE YOU AND WILL ASK YOU TO GO OUT...I will never recommend this hospital to anyone if you are concern about your health"
MouthShut,Max,"Dr. Neeraj Awasthy, Paediatric cardiologist, Max Saket, is the most dishonest doctor, I came across. He even went as far as to editing the documents which was already signed. Unfortunately, he did VSD device closure for my 6 month old baby which I came to know after the procedure that it was legally not supposed to be done for 6 month old child. Dr. Neeraj never explained me the risk factors but now he is claiming that device closure was high risk yet when I asked him for open- heart surgery. He said that my baby is a candidate for device closure. Little did I know, that he was experimenting on my baby to enhance his portfolio. Today, my baby is paralysed and may be brain- damaged.because Dr. Awasthy burst one of the chambers of his heart and put him under cardiac arrest. Let's hope Max will charge Dr. Awasthy for medical negligence. I plead to every parent for love of your child, never go to this doctor because today I sit with tears in my eyes looking at my baby. I have just came to know that this is not the first time that this happened. This is very sad to hear that he keeps getting away with this. All other Dr's are saying that u can't close a large musucalar vsd with a device. So can we still call Dr neeraj awasthi and experience Dr no ways he has no ethics.

MouthShut,Max,"Very good care and friendly staff, food is balanced for patient and attendant as advised, speciality units are well functioning."
MouthShut,Max,"Never go here. I said never. If you don't wanna waste your hard earned money then I highly recommended to not visit here. It's worst service provider hospital in North India. Max super speciality hospital staff, billing person are so cheap. They made 50k plus bill without inform attended about tests summary. They always take money at last after your alots of test being done without giving you any breif information, that they can take alot of money from patient attended. I highly recommend not to visit in any Max super speciality hospital branch. Even they don't ask about surgery they direct said your patient have to surgery next morning without giving any reason they decide themself patient needs to surgery so they can make alot of money form patient. Before that they do alot of multiple tests without giving any details to patient or attended. At last they give you a large bill in which you realise You have become an idiot by coming here."
MouthShut,Max,I fixed an online appointment with Dr. Nikunj Agarwal. I arrived at the hospital for my appointment and the lady at the billing counter advised that the doctor had not yet arrived but she will call him and he should be at the hospital soon. After calling a couple of times she informed that the doctor will not be coming and another junior doctor from his team will reach in 40 - 45 minutes and there is no other orthopaedic doctor available. Our contact numbers are only to spam us but not to give timely information. And to make matters worse today Max sends me a message saying I didn't show up for the appointment and need to be mindful and cancel in time.
MouthShut,Max,"Went to max saket with leg pain lingering fir months. 2 months down the line and after spending quite a lot, still don't know what the diagnosis is. That's not even the real problem, because the doctor is getting late, they make a patient with leg pain run around their huge campus across different buildings, just to mint more money. Because guess what , after all that unpleasantness for me, till day I have had less than 5 min of face time with the doctor."
MouthShut,Max,"My uncle who resides in Ghaziabad got discharged from Max Super Hospital - Vaishali - Ghaziabad one week before and was advised to have a follow up with the doctor after 5 days. He had the follow up scheduled which was done through a 25 second WhatsApp call for which full consultation charges were paid by him. Since the follow up call, he had been following up with the doctor and his staff to get post hospitilization medication. My uncle is not getting any support due to the irresponsible behaviour of the doctors as well as their assistants. He is losing all his faith and confidence for Max."
MouthShut,Max,"Mai aor mere husband 12th March ko Dr Hami se private appointment leker chackup ke liye gaye the. Hospital pahunch ne per humari appointment hi staff ne apne aap hi cansiled kardi. Humne full payment karne ke baad waiting ke liye bol diya. Karib 2pm hone per humara number aya. Checkup me test likhe jo karib 9 thousands ke huye humne sare test karwa bhi liye. Aor aaj jab hum unki Report checks karwane gaye tab hume pahle payment slips banane ko bola payment slip bhi banane ke baad sirff reports check karne ke liye hume 10.30 to 1.pm tak waits karne ke baad Doctor bahar aaker baad behaviour se kahne lagi ki mere staff ko bari bari bolne ki koi jarurat nahi. Apne pappers le ja sakte ho. Aor sare pappers fank diye mere husband ke upper. Jo critical suger aor heart me satants ke pains se aor mai sugar heart aor lever ki diseases se bimar hoon. Humara kasoor bas itna hai ki Sonipat me koi best treatment nahi milta aor hume Delhi jana pardta hai aor bahut galti huyi ki hum Max Saket chale gaye. Very sorry 60 years me first time humare sath aysa hua. Aaj se pahle kabhi Govts Hospitals me bhi nahi hua.

Iss report ko ager kahin sunvayi hogi ki nahi ye mai nahi janti per Uper Bhagwan ke paas jarur hogi. Mata Pita sabke old honge aor Bhagwan ke paas jarur jaynge. Thanks for bests."
MouthShut,Max,"On 6th night, we had to get our kid admitted in emergency. These are the most alarming issues which the patient and attendant had faced at such a late hour.

1) Admission & Room related issues: On admission, billing told that only room available is 4 bed sharing room despite of single room asked by attendant. After lot of requests, magically the twin sharing room appeared and assigned R.No.306 at 10pm.

The reason given by admission desk behind this magical appearance of 306 room is perhaps some normal ward patient was upgraded to these twin sharing rooms and now we will move them back and shift you in there. Really is it!!! I can easily spotted R.No.308 twin sharing basis was empty and spotted 3 single rooms 301, 305, 324 empty on same floor. Despite of so many availability, how come we have been denied at first. It was really a mental harassment at admission desk first.

Further, when the twin sharing room allotted, face following -

1.a) The bed wasn't ready when brought the patient from emergency room.

1.b) There was no bed back for resting support. On asking, first the staff said, will provide only in morning. On calling the supervisor, it got replaced with another bed after to n fro discussions.

1.c) We simply asked for 2 pillows (1 for patient and 1 for attendant) & 1 quilt (for attendant), but it was so ruckus. First, they sent dirty pillows or completely broken pillows. On asking for replacement, nothing showed up. Told to duty nursing staff and she then called herself to HK for pillow, but they again sent the quilt. Fortunately, the war of pillow and quilt ended after calling supervisor again.

1.d) Another issue about Corona guidelines - Despite of govt. official corona guidelines, they were not adhering in the room. The second patient's attendant wasn't wearing even mask.

I understand for small kids, the Corona test not to be done but how about the attendants of any patient. They could be the silent carriers (spreaders/receivers). In this crucial time of pandemic, how the c-19 appropriate behaviour can be maintained in such twin/four bed sharing rooms.

To be surprised, after multiple followups with Duty supervisor and to & fro to billing desk at midnight, again magically single room appeared and we got shifted to R.No.324 at around midnight 12:30am.

1.e) Moving to the new room, again the same issues - room wasn't prepared, no towel, no toiletries available. One simple thing about soap dispenser, given the open bottle without any cap or its dispenser unit (just an open bottle). Till morning no one replaced that bottle. At 7 am I called HK to send the proper soap dispenser and the staff appeared with dental kit and soap..seriously !!!

I myself is feeling embarrassed in writing such a small petty things, how the things are managing here.

2) Regarding the food given to the patient: After admission to room, proactively the dinner had sent for the patient. But surprising to see the goof up-

2.a) The patient have been admitted due to acute diarrhoea and doctor recommended a soft diet. What we got was Shahi Paneer, Gazar ka Halwa, Aalo beans. Really that's called a soft diet. Even the doctor/nursing staff on duty was also surprising and laughing. Again to & fro with kitchen, and finally got daal, aalo bean and khichdi which is also not at all suitable for such an accute diarrhoea patient.

2.b) Next morning, kitchen called to check what you would like to take for breakfast - Vegetable cutlet, Idli Sambhar, Upma. Really again is it us who are expert or is it dietician's responsibility to give the appropriate food as per patient condition?

On enquiring, we got to know there is no dietician expert available, only come after 9 or 9:30 am. So does that mean, a patient came with critical situation would rely on such poor knowledge kitchen people?

I am sorry but such things are not at all acceptable (one off always acceptable) for such a large reputed institution.

Believe me, I am not feeling any joy in writing such petty things. It should be hospital's duty to follow the protocols and guidelines.

The matter won't ended here. As I have made complaint during the stay, a lot of follow-ups have done by operation manager. Post-discharge also she called twice and apologize for the incidents. And as a token of compensation, send a goodie bag and some muffins/cakes ordered by max f&b dept thru Butter n Berry bakery. Unfortunately, those muffins were induced with live roaches .. Believe me, there is no value of lives here.

One person recovered 6 days ago with acute diarrhoea due to food poisoning and again hospital themselves sending contaminated food with live roaches. I have recorded videos too and planning to file a grievance in FSSAI soon.

Hats off to staff and services of MAX HOSPITAL, Vaishali.

Be careful while you step in next time there."
MouthShut,Max,"Poor services. Casual approach of doctors / staff

Poor Secaurity

Also doctors and nursing staff have no responsibility.

MouthShut,Max,Shown in Gynae...Not experienced doctors when compared to govt sector... But are money oriented... Just hospital business... Lots of tests esp scanning etc.. May be for meeting target...
MouthShut,Max,Very good experience. Doctors have excellence in their field.And the staff is also very cooperative.
MouthShut,Max,These doctors are so careless that they give wrong doses of medicines in Life Threatening disease like tuberculosis to a child and sometimes skip it also.
MouthShut,Max,"I was admitted in Max Saket for 2 days and I had a great experience there. The facility and staff were good.

Dietician (Anjali Saini) was really caring and helpful. She took care of me very nicely. She made me understand that it's not about sacrificing food rather it's about managing how to eat right in right time. She gave me what I wanted."
MouthShut,Max,Staff service and nature is very good. Very pleasant staff. Top quality from food department. Also would like to mention Shri Shivam who was assigned to our room provided good support & service.
MouthShut,Max,I am a doctor by profession and trust me I know the in and outs of corporate hospitals. Max Vaishali is the most pathetic setup ever witnessed by me… Most of the government hospitals are better that this… Doctor doing surgery did not even come for a follow up round even once… Patient’s IV antibiotic doses not given by nursing department… And when you ask them anything the staff is very rude…. Billing mei every patient suffering from ghaplas…
MouthShut,Max,"Dr khullar’s Nephrology Department in Max saket is the Best Doctor .

MouthShut,Max,"We take our mother for kidneys problems to nephrologist, but they admitted her in hospital in ICU & just started Dialysis after two days they put her on Ventilator although she was very concious but ICU doctors didn't care our patient she was crying for Dr's to just pull out VENTILATOR but the YUMDOOT doesn't care. They weren't Caring her BECAUSE of COLLECTING VENTILATOR & ICU CHARGES Every day at Very high Speed. Jab tak humko administration ke bad system ka pata chala Tab tak bahut Late ho gaye . Akhir hamne wahan upne Patient ko KHO DIYA. Hume wahan se pata chala ki ek baar Jab ye Ventilator laga dete hai to tab tak nahi nikalte jab tak Patient ki death na ho jaye.

IT VERY BAD EXPERIENCE AT HOSPITAL"
MouthShut,Max,"I was admitted to Max Saket hospital for Liver Transplant under Prof. Subhash Gupta and team including team at LTPICU was great as they took very good care while my stay at hospital.

To be specific::-

Nursing staff:- Neha, Amrita and Robin they all are very good, well mannered, fast and caring throughout my stay.

GDA:- Very harsh on them as there were just in 2 GDA for 10-15 ICU rooms but they tried to manage themselves specially Adnan.

Doctor's:- All the doctors were very caring towards me.

Thank you all."
MouthShut,Max,My patient was admitted in saket max hospital he had a road traffic accident he was under Dr Shaleen Agarwal treatment (he was in good hands). All the staff in the hospital were very cooperative and caring towards my patient he was on 4th floor room no 3412 all the staff took good care of him and we were discharge with most affection and care. Thanks to the whole team of the hospital for helping us in our hard time. Thank you.
MouthShut,Max,Please never go to attend visa medical at max. They dont process it on time. Sometimes takes more than one month and there is long wait when you go to attend medical. They dont care about age or medical conditions. I have reported to Australian immigration to remove their name from panel list so other people dont suffer. There charges are high than other panel clinic but still dont provide time efficient service.
MouthShut,Max,"I met Dr. Viveka kumar in Max superspeciality hospital Saket some 11 years back. A very corrupt doctor had done my angiography 8and told me that there is 90% blockage in my LCA and 99% blockage in my RCA. I panicked and went to Dr. Viveka Kumar who within minutes told me that the blockage in my LCA is 50% only and further stated that this much blockage even he would be having that much blockage.After many years i got CT ANGIOGRAPHY DONE AND THE BLOCKAGE IN LCA TURNED OUT EXACTLY 50% WHAT DR. VIVEKA KUMAR TOLD ME MANY YEARS EARLIER. This year in 2021 sometime in August i had problems of peripheral artery disease and I went to Dr. Viveka Kumar who got my angiography done and found that there was 100 percent blockage in my left leg but told me that I have very good collaterals and there is no need of any surgery. He gave me a new nedicine which is extremely effective. Dr. Viveka Kumar apart from being brilliant studies a lot. He is not greedy or commercial at all and is extremely quick to grasp any situation. He is a very alert doctor and the best cardioligist in I dia. I advise people to go to Dr. Viveka Kumar for any cardilogy related problems. He should be on the worlds highest medical traffic site https://medhelp.org which has worlds finest doctors. Thanks Dr. Viveka Kumar.

MouthShut,Max,Callous attitude. Emergency staff pathetic. Dr Sohail and his staff killed my uncle. He did not bring adrenaline for a dying patient. If you want your patient to be alive don't take them there.
MouthShut,Max,I tried to give them feedback but It was not possible on their site after I received my report they even gave me the link to write a feedback but not possible I don’t know why. The receptionist Ranvir was so so rude to me I asked him for a help and he wasn’t even responding his attitude is sky high . And he is not feeling sorry at all. He even asked for my ID proof. He’s not at all fit to be a receptionist! SMH! The rudest person I met since birth and the suprising part is he’s the hospital (Max Gurugram Hospital) receptionist. I wish Ranvir doesn’t treat someone like the way he treated me. And thanks to the guy (who has a tattoo on his neck) who helped me he was so so polite and good to me thanks to him.
MouthShut,Max,"My 89 year old mother was admitted for the 7th time. This time for a partial hip replacement. She is in room 3408 (single).

The doctors and nursing staff are excellent. Prices have been increased by about 20% from pre covid days.

GDA availability and training is disastrous. Yesterday she wetted the sheets 4 times while passing urine in the bowl. Had to wait a long time for changing them. Today held her urine for 30 min as no GDA was available.

Took a long time to get diaper sheets.

Took a long time to arrange a mask for her as she had to go downstairs for physiotherapist.

She had undergone surgery for colon diverticulitis, so cannot tolerate milk and cheese. Had requested dietician to replace these with some extra fruits( a minute bowl is provide only for lunch). Imagine my surprise, they charged Rs 20 extra for this !!! Such pettiness is unthinkable.

Cup has old milk deposit on its rim, which I could scratch out. See photo.

Overall a very irritating experience because of such petty issues"
MouthShut,Max,"Totally money sucker people....

At reception area at the time of admission....they explanation about procedure verbally. And at last at bill submitted time their words totally changed .... example at admission time at night 10 p.m they told half day for next morning till 11.am. but at billing department they told paid full day amount ...also billing agent told you should take it on paper the one who told for half day......

No sleeping arrangements for

night at emergency/icu/ventilator patients's family member"

MouthShut,Max,"We had a very bad experience with online doctor appointment with fee also paid for my wife Mrs Anju kilam . Yesterday we had appointment at 10am and on reaching the online desk ortho at Ist floor for confirmation , we were told there is no appointment visible in there system and then we had to take fresh appointment and pay the fee again & after sometime they agreed online appointment was there , it's some error , now they will refund it in next five days time , it's quite absurd n strange , billing desk is poorly supervised & refund still awaited , our experience with Dr Akhilesh Yadava was superb and his diagnosis was very good and Dr Akhilesh was very motivating and helpful, that saved our day .Max management need to look into such issues immediately and process our fee refund ."
MouthShut,Max,"I made an appt with Dr. Shalabh Aggarwal, who was not there and was asked to see a much older gentleman Dr Yogesh Gautam… who apparently does not do the surgeries.

Dr Gautam diagnosed me as having a hernia in my abdomen and gall stones.

I was operated upon by Dr Shalabh Agarwal, who informed me post surgery that there was NO hernia and

small gall stone. Without any approval from me or my relative they removed my gall bladder. They poked 7 holes in my abdomen with 2 stitches in most holes.

I am warning everyone against consulting with Dr Yogesh Gautam, I am told they usually do this kind of treatment with CGHS pensioners

Pls beware"
MouthShut,Max,"Post examine in the car they admitted my MIL, just in some hour's we got the news that our MIL is in critical stage, however last night she was talking with us in a very clear voice.

I want to mention the incident which was happen in just some hours post admitting at the ICU ward MICU 4 floor, at max hospital dehradun, one of rhe attendent misbehaved with my seniour citizen Mother in law.

My sister in law, who was staying in the hospital when requested to the night MOD to meet our mother at the nigt time, so that she can come to know what is her health status, same was approved but when my SIL met with MIL in the ICU and my mother shared the incident that one of staff behaviour was very rude to her and she had forcefully tried to feed her big bites of food and also threatened her. While speaking this issue her voice was very clear that she has threaten her.

My SIL and BIL (broher in law) has shared this issue with the present doctor in ICU and when she came out from the icu they both called the head and shared the same thing. They clearly mention to that night head incharge we are going to share this thing in the morning meeting.

He assured us that nothing wrong will happen with your patient but since we were very scared after that incident as our mother was inside of the icu, so we decided to keep quiet.

We also ask the security to check that lady in the CCTV footage but they said there is no camera in the ICU.

We request to the management please look into this or else we have no other option then escalating this issue to the higher authority.

At the morning we got the news our mother in law is almost dead.

We found many spots and patches on her body"

MouthShut,Max,"Worst hospital... Money makers they are..

Irresponsible doctors, irresponsible staff...

No humanity, no social responsibility...

Nobody should go there...."
MouthShut,Max,"Where do I begin from? This

‘Doctor’ took away my best friends father. The whole family were being lied to about his progress… while his health was getting worse he would tell the family that he was in fact getting better. My uncle shouldn’t have started chemo due to his condition.. there were other options but the doctor had taken this decision. Oral

Tablets could’ve been used but this was administered a few days before he passed away.

All I can say is that this doctor should be avoided at all costs"
MouthShut,Max,"She directly told us to get all the tests under the sun done before even looking at the patient only to increase our bill. Then she looked at the patient diagnosed her wrong disease, moreover she was rude as hell. How did we know? Other doctor from the same hospital had diagnosed patient with some other disease. Then we went to Some other hospital for third opinion and got to know that the patient doesn’t have any disease, the problem was weak eyes because of age.

She should just quit her profession if she can’t talk to her patients properly.

She literally rolled her eyes when the patient asked her question.

I was like dude, no. You can’t do that. You are going to treat that patient."
MouthShut,Max,"We have taken appointment for MRI today 21st Sep 2021 at 05 pm which was taken a week before. My patient is in the hospital and itz now 0930 p.m. but yet done MRI .

My patient has to go for an echo test today but that also not done and we are here since 09 am. They are just harassing our patient"
MouthShut,Max,"Very unprofessional .

She will not give you enough time and will not assist with the details .

It's my first pregancy and she made me so confused.

She will not tell you proper details , infact she will be in hurry all the time.Its sad to see doctor like her who are just need money and forget that they are doctors.

Highly disappointed with the service ."
MouthShut,Max,"Billing and admissions are horrible. They MAX makes fake Bills and no one corrects them. No one bothers about it. They hate CGHS card HOLDERS and many doctors charge arbitrarily. One doctor a diablogist has killed many patients including two of my wife. He probably has fake degrees which he got from a fake medical college in BIHAR. HE REJECTS CGHS AND CHARGES 2000 RS. HIS LICENSE SHOULD BE CANCELLED. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO NEGATIVE SCORING AS OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN NEGATIVE SCORING.

MouthShut,Max,"This one is for all the Hills people thinking Max is their only hope - Came here on friday with my dad for increased Cretanine (over 10), Doctor who was in a hurry to pick a flight asked to take an appointment for Monday or Wednesday so that would have been a wait of 3-5 days. To protect theirselves from defaming the emergency guys told they do not have ICU beds available and recommended two different hospitals (one recomendded by nurse and the other by a management guy). Wont say they are after money as surely there must be plenty of it. But denying an admission( upon knowing you have an ECHS perhaps or for doctor's unavailabilty or non approval to accept patient) after first letting you know that its possible is as close to endangering their life."

The staff Nurse Robin Charan is a great resource and is a helpful & staff. He has gone beyond his duty call & hasprojected a great CFD Client focus delivery approach. He has represented the immaculateresponsibility in handling all the different situations comforted while handling critical clients in the ICU.

MouthShut,Max,"This hospital is the most pathetic hospital I have ever come across. My aunt had a fluctuation of heartbeats so the junior doctor suggested her to give her medicine which will go on for 24 hours. We took the general ward on the advice of the doctor but then the head of the department came in and she said that she will be admitted to ICU. We tried to ask her but she didn't answer anything(Stupid Doctor). My aunt was stable the whole time, her oxygen was normal, her heartbeat was normal and all vitals were normal as well but despite that, she was admitted to the ICU just for the sake of money. This was not the first time she went through this fluctuation of heartbeat but every time it would get normal bit this time it was our bad luck that due to Covid going on, we couldn't reach to our general physician so took her to MAX DEHRADUN just for normal body routine check but this hospital exists just for sake of getting money from the patients."
MouthShut,Max,"The hospital is like a 5 star hotel, like a hotel they just make profits and they forget about patients lost two of my closed relatives in just a month. They just fool you around about the treatment not let you get discharged and finally we lost two lives and yes we spend money like water to save still all in vein. Please don't go to the hospital if you really care for yourself and loved one."
MouthShut,Max,"My mother got admitted to room no 2433 D1 in Covid in May, 21 and let me tell you that doctors and nurses and other support staff at MAX Saket are very experienced and have a humane angle inbuilt into each one of them.

MouthShut,Max,"We admitted our father 11 days, due to dr bhatti, ccu in charge lost our father he is not good person he should not be doctor he should be watchmen or security , all the bad words for him are less, ashish who was in emergency section in reception before we admitted he is number one stupid, , now that guy is accounts, night emergency guy garhwali don’t know how to talk to attendant, in the night time most and the emergency guy busy sleeping , max is paying him for sleeping, may be your parents will die then you will realise what is hospital, you should take of the attendant my father was ill and he can not take even the phone to pick up, we just wanted to only ask if he is ok, had food , but this reception guys they are so ill-mannered and rude and bad tempered, they own the hospital, we are paying huge amount of money, but we lost our father, never ever suggest anyone to come to this hospital, on 19"

Dont know how to speak with elder ones...

Uneducated women"
MouthShut,Max,Nothing except looting patients taking opportunity of earning maximum in covid time only to get admit patient any type of case to earn later not attending patient even for medicines that's why most of the death cases I observed in this hospital bullshit hospital it should be closed need to take strict action against this hospital max Vaishali hospital is far better than money making ppj. Max hospital I observed how they treat patient all people should come together to complaint this hospital
MouthShut,Max,I admitted my mother for angioplasty operation but after angioplasty operation her leg was not working and doctor didn't tell us about this problem and after two days when my mother realize that her leg is not working then doctors made one more operation for her leg and even after the operation her leg is not working properly. This is the reality of this 5 star hospital.
MouthShut,Max,"Please trained your staff at desk. They have arrogant behaviour towards CGHS patients.

Radiology department denied x-ray. They demanded endorsed document of government doctor. If patient already have refferal from government doctor, then why did you again demanded endorsement. Doctor vikas gupta had prescribe x-ray to my mother for knee pain, and radio department denied it..even I was willing to pay non CGHS rate.

Worst department."
MouthShut,Max,"When my son was admitted on last chemo then i was meet your lady security guard arti sharma, she was very nice behaviour, helping nature, these type of staff is maintaining your hospital prestige anyway nice treatment are there everything is good."
MouthShut,Max,When I got covid 19 positive I could get admitted in around 3-4hr and that day I could get first food from hospital at 9pm even I was on bed around on 3.30pm. Dr's were aware that I am a sugar patient and I could take only breakfast at home before admission. Same food problem I faces all 5 days. Medicines were also not according my problem. Due to corona Medicine my sugar was getting increased and they didn't include any Medicine to control sugar and when it reached 290 then directly given insulin for that. Discharge process took more 24hs with lot of issues. They didn't allowed mobile phones and one common phone was there which was using by all patients to spread virus between all. I got too much week in these 5 days due to delays in food and proper medicine. I will never recommend to anybody for MAX.
MouthShut,Max,"I got the COVID vaccination today at Max Hospital. The registration, verification and vaccination was seamless and smooth. The staff was helpful, hospitable and courteous. Our congratulations.

MouthShut,Max,"Today I and my husband got Covid vaccination.

We waited for Max Gurgaon to get permission for Covid Vaccination.

Our experience today was very pleasant.All the staff supporting the Vaccination from the moment we entered till we got our Certificate , our experience was of very supportive staff and very well organised every step of the procedure.We are so happy to have waited one week and lived upto their professionally managed hospital reputation with no trace of any chaos.

All the best for our favourite hospital"
MouthShut,Max,"One of the worst hospital. My dad was admitted in this hospital, neuro surgical ICU. He was in coma like condition. After 14 days when we shifted him to another hospital found bed sores on his back and near butt area. They only change the upper bed sheets from patient who cannot speak and do not care about bed sheets under the patient. Staff and doctors never listen to you even if you tell them that patient cannot take strong medicine. Still they will heavy dose medicine to patient. Neuro surgical department is one the failure of this hospital. Staff only have degrees and gold medals but on ground they do nothing. They just watch and charge you a heavy amount on daily basis. Never admit your patient here, my father passed away just because of these fraudsters."
MouthShut,Max,"Excellent hospital with excellent facility. Overall good performance from entire team. Very friendly behavior all.

It's one of the best hospital in Delhi it comes on top in research and development of new methods for corona patients. The plasma therepy was first experiment here in all India. We don't know yet the benefits of plasma therepy ( since only the people with>40% titer are responding better) but still we can appreciate the effort of experimenting new stuff even in these times. It gave hope to a lot of people."
MouthShut,Max,"I have admitted in Max Hospital on 16feb. I had asudden seizure first time at night. I had admitted in hospital for two days . After discharge, doctors gave me medicines which is given by nurse. On discharge summary medicine is levera 750 mg but nurse gave the packet of levoflox- 750mg . I don't know mistake was done by nurse or pharmacy . But there is a huge mistake I had take this wrong medicine for 7 days that has a bad impact on me like mood swings, bodyache , headache , nausea so important information is that this levoflex medicine is given to cure the lungs problem very bad experience in this hospital. I think strict action will be taken by hospital against this negligence done by staff. It will harm the life of a person."
MouthShut,Max,"Very Very Wrost Hospital..in Delhi NCR..

Very Very Wrost Service and Wrost management

Very poor and Rude behaviour of admission staff and Duty manager inside the Hospital.....pls don't go here for any type of Treatment....."
MouthShut,Max,"A very poor experience overall.

A good team of doctors - which is absolutely let down at the administrative and management end.

My wife and I were admitted here with COVID. A room was allotted, but we were asked to wait as the treating doctors wanted to get a CT scan of the chest down for both of us before shifting to the room. It is logistically complex to move COVID patients around they said, and we agreed. we waited for around 3 hours - which was okay, considering all things.

However, once the CT was finally done and reviewed, we were transferred to the erstwhile assigned room, only to find, the same room had been assigned to someone else now! There was another patient in the room we were officially admitted in, and this guy obviously refused to move to another room. And we were told there were no other rooms available. So, after all the admission formalities were completed and the room assigned, and after waiting for 3 hours, we were plainly denied a room. The bill at this point was roughly 80-90k for both of us, and no insurance would cover it if the admission wasn't for 24 hours.

This whole thing went on roughly for an hour and a half.

If it had ended here, it would have been still fine. But my wife and I were woken up at midnight by the staff. And we were taken for a CT son again! The same scan we had waited 3 hours for. Both of us tried to explain to them that we had already had the CT of the chest done, but this staffer said maybe the doctor wants another scan. maybe the first scan was not good quality. and a few more rubbish excuses. I also tried to reason with them to postpone it to morning if it was not an urgency, upon which we were just SCOLDED by this guy and were asked to shut up!

I am 63. My wife is 57.

The next morning, we asked the doctor about this second scan. And he was as surprised as we were. He had NEVER asked for this repeat scan. Moreover, the morning staff had NO IDEA even if a CT scan was done at all.

After raising this issue, someone called and apologized. Now the extra dose of radiation could not be taken back, but at least we were assured we won't be charged for the second scan. But we were. The charge was only removed upon repeated reminders.

Again, I wouldn't have been writing this review if this had been it. T couple of days later, WE WERE AGAIN WOKEN UP AT AROUND 1 AM - AGAIN FOR A GOD-FORBIDDEN CT SCAN! This time, however, we just refused to get going and asked to call the doctor and confirm first. So, a third CT was not done.

Now, at the time of discharge and billing, I ended up paying around 35000 due to some error at the hospital's end. This included the gruesome and exorbitant charges what max charged for those PPEs! And it was obviously denied by the insurance company. I was asked to claim a reimbursement for the rest from my insurance provider - which would take at least a few months, if not more.

I honestly have no issue in paying for what's rightful. And I will not go into the exorbitant and illogical charges Max adds to the bill. At least provide the service that on par with the money you ask for! If your room costs more than what hotels like Radisson or Leela or Pullman charge, at least teach your staff to be courteous and knowledgeable. And for the last thing, please teach the staff to listen to what the patient says - for it's the patients that paying for your salaries eventually.

Doctors - 5 stars.

Nursing care - 3.5 stars(partly responsible for the CT fiasco)

Management - A BIG THUMBS DOWN!

Overall experience - POOR."
MouthShut,Max,Good experience. Was taken well care of health check up with proper guidance at every stage. Good breakfast and helpful admin’s particularly Himanshu and good lab work. Proper doctor consultation
MouthShut,Max,"Ishrat mam done a great job for us and she was very kind to us she genuinely take care of my Mother She was such a soft hearted woman

Thank you mam for such helps

Lots of blessings to uhhh??????

I think the all staff will be like ishrat mam"
MouthShut,Max,"Doctors, Nurses and other staff are very supportive, caring and understanding. Facilities and other services are very good and excellent. Specially thanks to Dr Deepa Dewan, Dr Nalini, Dr Asmita, Coordinator - Deepika Sethi and anaesthesia team . My mother got surgery and she treated very well and got extra assistance and utmost care here. In Gurgaon I can say Max is the best. Awesome experience. Thanks to all.,"
MouthShut,Max,"Hospital is good. Staff is polite & prompt with solving issues. Stay was comfortable. Facility is clean & well maintained.

Atul & Rajesh were very helpful."
MouthShut,Max,"We were given an appointment of 11 whereas the doctor was not in till 12.30. Better to take clinic appointment than in this hospital. The receptionist was rude and did not listen the urgency. Inspite high fee, very very poor service."
MouthShut,Max,"My father was admitted in emergency ward and had his CABG done by Doctor Subhash Kumar Sinha.

My father had two fainting bouts, which looked like seizures, on the 4th and 7th day after his CABG and while he was still at Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket.

The first time, the staff rushed my father to the ICU and kept him under observation and on ventilator for half a day. The doctor attributed the bout to my father's age(75yrs) and recovery post CABG. We were told its because of'excessive coughing' and lack of oxygen supply, whereas, my father did not have any cough around that time.

The second time he fainted, we sought further clarification and the doctor said these side effects happen at his age as CABG is a big ask and the symptom will stay'lifelong'. The doctor's and the nursing staff were not comforting and did not pay any attention to these symptoms. They brushed it under the carpet and we were told that our father is ready for discharge.

It was shocking for us to have no clarifications, and so we decided to take a second opinion from Medanta, Gurgaon. Medanta did his brain MRI when we had to take him to the emergency ward, due to another seizure. Through MRI, they found out that he had a stroke and has multiple blood clots in his brain and that's why he is getting these seizure like fainting spells. My father was admitted at Medanta for 5 days and treated for his condition. Thankfully, the neurologist at Medanta could diagnose and immediately put him medication.

My father did not have any neurological condition or such history of such symptoms at all, before the CABG done at Max Saket. We have all records to support our claim and this feedback.

Of course, We wonder till date why the doctors at Max Saket did not think of any neurological intervention or tests for proper diagnosis. Probably because they were aware of their negligence either during or post CABG in ICU? It seems quite obvious. They treat patients like vegetables. The doctors are unethical and do not care.

We give this feedback on social media with a hope that we can caution people of this ruthless and completely unethical behaviour of doctors and staff at MAX Saket super-speciality hospital."

JustDial,Max,"My experience at Max Super Speciality Hospital was disappointing. Postop care was especially poor and there was no team assigned for easy communication. We had to struggle to follow up for the next steps and for every small issue, they wanted us to visit the hospital so they could charge a consultation fee.

JustDial,Max,"Pathetic services, money making machine and doesn`t care about patients. Emergency is attended in not less than 45 mins. A senior citizen suffering from parkinson disease was refused even in emergency."
JustDial,Max,"I was having acute throat infection and went to Dr. Anurag Tandon (Sr. Consultant ENT) in MAX Patparganj for that problem. He is the worst doctor I have ever met. He boasts of his experience and years he has spent in this profession but the truth is that he mistreats patients by giving wrong treatment to lure money from them. Instead of treating me in the hospital itself, he asked me to come to his private clinic and misguided me to fetch extra money. Please don`t go to this doctor."
JustDial,Max,"My mother ( 57 years old ) was suffering from CKD and was on conservative medicine. A ulcer in her mouth was upsetting her in December, 2012. She went to a well known dentist in East Delhi. On every visit he kept on scaling the molar tooth on left saying that the ulcer was because of that tooth. He prescribed gel, gargles with lukewarm water and an anti-biotic( Augmentin625) . Above all on March 07, 2013, he arranged a surgeon at his clinic to extract the tooth .

JustDial,Max,"Preventative health check up.Overcrowded, long queues, nowhere to sit, everyone in a horrible rush. I`m not sure any of the tests were done responsibly given the rush. Some tests weren`t done as the doctor had gone home. Doctors too rushed through tests as they had no time. Horrible experience. Never again."
JustDial,Max,The care at Max Multi Speciality Centre is terrible. The standards are low and the staff seem indifferent. I wouldn`t recommend this place to anyone.

MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo Belapur cannot be trusted.

I had a very bad experience start from the surgery to discharge.

They sent unrealistic bill to insurance team and later couldn't provide justification for the bill, at the end patient and their family to suffer mentally.

Don't choose Apollo Belapur."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I went for a DMO role a few months back . Mamatha singh has no respect for my qualifications & experience. She blames organisation for less wages . On my face she said you aren't the only one who are qualified & had some experience. If not you we will get many others. The other HR is very good cool headed & tried to calm her down. But she is not listening. Superintendent liked me very much but Mamtha singh gave bad feedback saying very bad conduct. So I got rejected there.

She is representing a big organisation & this is how she behave with the person who is holding MBBS degree."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I had dengue fever and I got admitted into this hospital and they started treating me as soon as I got admitted since my platelets were at a very low amount and I personally love the way how doctors come and consult me every

Though the medical expenses are very high , the doctors working there are very experienced, infrastructure is also very good"
MouthShut,Apollo,"I visited Apollo Hospitals, Bannerghatta Road(Bengaluru) from Tanzania between March 1626, 2025, for a routine medical check-up(ref. AHB0001298094). Overall, I received a satisfactory care from competent and dedicated doctors and other Hospital staff. However, I had a very bad experience with Dental Department. On March 25, I underwent a full-mouth laser gingival curettage and received a crown-and-bridge placement which involved exorbitant charges of INR86, 859(over USD1, 000), plus INR9, 567 for a root canal. Upon returning to Tanzania, on April 14 I noticed the crowns beginning to chip, and within a week they had completely detached. When I reported this to the Dental Department, I was offered a complimentary replacement bridge but this would involve local dentist consultation in Tanzania, digital impressions, bite registration, and subsequent refitting at my own cost. I declined the offer, not only due to the expense but also because of my concerns about the crowns quality and the risks of coordinating two different dentists across countries. Instead, I requested a full refund of my total treatment cost(INR96, 426).

Since no agreement was reached, I escalated the matter to the International Patients Department. I received a notification stating that an International Patients Representative would contact me. However, I have not heard from anyone. The only communication I have received were internal email exchanges, on which I was merely copied.

This experience has been deeply disappointing, especially considering Apollo Hospitals esteemed reputation in Tanzania and globally. As an international patient, I have placed my trust and my resources in care of this hospital, expecting the best out of it. I hope the hospital addresses this promptly and ensures better support for international patients in similar situations."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Coming all the way from West Bengal, I placed my trust in Apollo Hospital — and I’m glad I did. As a patient, what matters most is feeling safe, cared for, and heard. From the moment I arrived, the professionalism and empathy of the staff made a strong impression.

The doctors here are not only highly skilled but also attentive and patient in explaining every step of the treatment process. Nurses and support staff were kind, efficient, and always available, even during the toughest moments.

Traveling such a long distance for medical care isn’t easy, but Apollo gave me confidence and peace of mind that I was in the right hands. I chose this hospital for its reputation, and my experience lived up to — and exceeded — expectations.

If there’s one thing I’d say to other patients: if you’re looking for quality treatment and people who truly care, Apollo Hospital is a place you can trust."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I’m truly heartbroken and disappointed. After waiting patiently for over a month to consult Dr. Rooma Sinha—putting all my hope and trust into finally getting help—I was told at the last moment that she wouldn't be available. There was no prior notice, no message, no courtesy call—nothing. If she knew she wouldn’t be available, why not inform patients at least a week earlier?

This wasn’t just an appointment—it was something I was counting on for my health and peace of mind. The lack of communication felt careless and disrespectful. Time, trust, and emotional investment—all wasted. I expected better from someone in such a respected position."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I Lost my brothers life here. just 18 days before with Admition of just 1 and half day. and bill was Rs. 550000, and outcome is ""Death""

This is not Hospital. it is money making Organisation, here Nursing Staff very unknowledgeble . Admition Manager ""Vaishali Jagdale"" behaviour also Very Casual and Bad. After Admition of Patient. which was not before Admition.

Finally i want serious Attention of people. don't go here with your loveble familly members. Govt Authorities plz take some Serious Action. on this Hospital."
MouthShut,Apollo,The patients should think twice before opting for treatment as they will charge exorbitant amount for Miscellaneous charges and will not give proper breakups with clarity in the estimates which you take before operation from them
MouthShut,Apollo,Their call centers keep calling and send several SMS’ to confirm appointments. Lot of Spam. Over rated hospitals. Just go to another health care provider to better care at lower prices.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Dr. A.G.K. Gokhale and his doctor's team was excellent with all the necessities provided.

Also all the nurses from Bengal in ICU section was very attentive and helpful. Overall experience was very smooth."
MouthShut,Apollo,My daughter is doing dialysis in Apollo hospital chennai. she is a patient since 2009. The dialysis cost is huge. We are paying so much but the food they provide is horrible. So less quantity they serve it cold . We from northeast do not eat curd rice and rice is too little. Please improve your food quality and quantity!!
MouthShut,Apollo,Worst experience with Optometry/Dental Department as no value for Time of Patient but they want timely payment without any hesitation.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Try to avoid this hospital as much as possible . Doctors are ok , but nursing staff is pathetic . They almost killed my wife ."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Very unhygienic, there were rats running in the single rooms too. Even after complaint, no action was taken. They are not using latest medical equipments, they used 18 gauge needle for spinal fluid test which is not latest..didnt use any ultrasound or local anaesthesia..poked my dad 8 times in the spine..couldn't do it right even once and he is highly diabetic and they didn't even care to wipe off the blood after or put a plaster on it..he went through a lot of pain and suffering that he literally asked for poison instead, even when he didn't give consent after 3 pricks, they proceeded without consent and forcefully pricked him 8 times. Dr. Sarmistha Panigrahi (Anaesthesiology) was the one responsible for it. The skill and education of her is really questionable. Very lazy staff even after calling them multiple times, they don't come and attend us even when they are free, they just sit and chat. So careless they don't attend the patient on time and so negligent in giving medicines..they gave dolo instead of diabetic medicine once. Since we are educated enough we could tell the difference..just imagine the harm it can cause to naive people. When the negligence was confronted they didn't even apologize. Too over priced for the services provided. Just another commercial branded hospital. Not patient centric like they market."
MouthShut,Apollo,"My father was living a good life in the village, I don't know in which unlucky moment I brought him to Apollo navi Mumbai to get him treated by a good doctor, I did not know that a good doctor would silence him forever. And the hospital administration killed him in the name of angiography, Even though I am blaming on Dr Sanjeev team in anger, but the real culprit is me. Doctors profession is such that always see incidents of death in the hospital, someone's death may be a normal thing for them, but what difficulties the death of a person may cause to his family, it may not make any difference to them

Today, I have suffered the biggest loss. My children's education was run from his pension money, because I was unable to maintain the family with my small job. Now, even the children's education will remain incomplete because my main support is gone.

I want answer only these 3 questions from apollo navi mumbai

1.Did I take him to you in a dying condition?

2.If I had not got angioplasty done as per hospital advice, how many days would he have lived?
Can I get the cctv footage of 13th July 24 from 5 am to 9 pm to know what all happened to him because even the staff of Apollo is not trustworthy.
Dr. Sanjeev is a good doctor but some of his team members were very careless and that became the reason for my father's death. I wanted to know what happened to him but they are not giving me the CCTV footage even though there was a camera installed near his bed."
MouthShut,Apollo,"In CBD Apollo Emergency I was diagnosed for not keeping well. The emergency doctor was so rude named Dr. Nitishaa that first she didn't bothered patient is waiting for treatment later she was being so rude with the patient for why you did ECG you have some cardiac issue then only we do ECG and when I was diagnosed with no medical issue still she was forcing to do multiple test so that the amount of bill can be increased.

She was always giving excuses for not making the discharge paper as one of the staff told let 2 hours be over 3k patients have to pay along with other bills

If a patient is feeling okay and report are normal I think it's the right of the doctor to discharge the patient. Dr. Nitishaa need to behave with her patient she was being so rude even other patients started saying she is so rude."
MouthShut,Apollo,"It was a beautiful experience with doctor Aradhya , We are a foreign couple come to India to have children and we were afraid who would be the best doctor for this decision, but Apollo Hospital in Kondapur is the best place for treatment, and thanks to God & D.Aradhya, the first attempt of IVF was successful, and I recommend everyone to go to this wonderful hospital."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I was admitted in emergency due to fracture on Tibia and Fibula. I had to undergo surgery with nailing and plate. Hospital had initially taken cashless approval against my corporate ICICI policy, however, when we saw the estimate especially room rate, the hospital has shown room rate as INR 8200 whereas for same room they were charging INR 5000 from individuals as well as some other insurance companies. Since my room limit under corporate policy was less than INR 8200, I decided to use my personal Star health policy and asked hospital to get the cashless authorisation against Star Health policy which we got within 2 hours. After getting the approval I had categorically written to hospital of our intention of using Star Health Policy. To our utter surprise the hospital first got the claim realised from Star health on 28th May and submitted another bill to ICICI on 3rd June so that they can claim the amount twice to in tease their profit by fraud. ICICI also paid the claimed amount to Apollo. When I checked with Apollo, they just said that it is a human error.

From this it is clear that hospital is trying all unfair means to make money as they had knowingly submitted another claim to ICICI which shows fraudulent practices being followed by Apollo and puts a question mark on their so called ethical practices.

In my openion one should only go to Apollo if they have someone known working in hospital"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Dr Sudhir Kumar is money minded dr all he care abou the amount you paid for the consultation, hes busy with the phone and if you ask questions he wil send you another dr, hes very rude honestly, sad to such unprofessional dr in Apollo field"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Good Afternoon, I came for a consultation for Dr Satish Kotla and I am waiting in the lobby for one hour and their is no Air conditioning and outside the hospital the temperature in Hyderabad is around 42degrees is this the treatment you people are giving to the patients,"
MouthShut,Apollo,We went to Apollo hospital for my father's treatments and our experience is average. Good treatment good administration.
MouthShut,Apollo,Food service staff Pavithra provides good service to my mother she is a very caring girl. Other services have to improve more.
MouthShut,Apollo,"My sister had to undergo Gall bladder removal. Liver biposy was done . Surgery went well but the doctor who suggested surgery "" Dr Bharat Kumar"" is pathetic without medical ethics. Based on Liver biopsy he tells my sister "" Your life is OVER. You will have to spend rest of your life on steroids which will cause other health concerns"". But since the serology report was negative about AUTO Immune Disorder. He told her to consult Liver Transplant Specialist of Apollo for second opinion. My sister couldnt sleep for a week. After a week we decided to take her to another Doctor from Global Hospital and he was surprised to know the kind of scary language Dr Bharat used. Finally series of tests were redone there . Her Liver block was received from and given to Global Hospital and biopsy ruled out chances of Auto Immune PBC and instead said the duct narrowing was either due to intake of some other medicines or Gall bladder issue. Basically biopsy report of Apollo was wrong and Dr Bharat doesnt know how to talk to patients. Which doctor would tell his patients that their life is over ?...After surgery behaviour of nurses in ICU was super rude and they scolded my sister when she said its paining."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to undergo lumpectomy surgery done by Dr. Sandeep The first time I met him, my fear of cancer was completely gone. Dr. made me feel at ease through his friendly behaviour and cheerful disposition. He explained to me, in layman's terms, my medical condition and how I will be completely cured of cancer after the surgery and other allied treatments. His confident attitude, friendly behaviour made me undergo my cancer treatment with lot of ease. Dr. surgical skills are also excellent. I did not feel any discomfort or pain after the surgery and the wounds healed very fast. He is also an excellent human being and I strongly recommend Dr"
MouthShut,Apollo,Best service and hospital working process such a great and the workers behaviour mind-blowing and osm
MouthShut,Apollo,Best hospital facilities are also good best staff best doctors and food is also and fresh for patients
MouthShut,Apollo,"Third class service. Worst experience. Ticket keeps getting postponed. Very bad call center service.

Only making money from AMC no service"

MouthShut,Apollo,Good behaviour in hospital staff and doctor and easily all facility are available in one roof thanks ????
MouthShut,Apollo,"I am writing to share a distressing experience my family had at Apollo Hospital Navi Mumbai last weekend, specifically in relation to the services provided by Dr. Swapnil Gosavi (ENT). It is with great disappointment that I recount the events, hoping to raise awareness and caution others from falling victim to similar situations.

Last weekend, my aunt faced a medical emergency when a small wire became lodged in her throat during dinner. To seek prompt assistance, we rushed her to Apollo Hospital Navi Mumbai. To our dismay, instead of a quick resolution, the hospital subjected her to a series of unnecessary tests and admitted her to the standard ward overnight.

The wire was eventually removed the next morning via endoscopy by Dr. Swapnil Gosavi. However, our ordeal did not end there. Despite her improving condition, the hospital insisted on keeping her for further observation in the general ward. When I requested discharge in the evening, they declined, insisting on an additional day's stay.

The shock came when we were presented with a bill totaling Rs. 1, 93, 000, justifying it as a complicated surgery and a severe level emergency case. When I questioned the billing department, I was redirected to Dr. Swapnil Gosavi, who displayed a dismissive and rude attitude. He insensitively mentioned the disturbance to his sleep, claiming a thankless job and asserting that such costs were expected at a hospital like Apollo.

I confronted Dr. Swapnil with valid concerns, questioning why she was not placed in the ICU if it was a severe emergency and why the procedure took place at morning. Unfortunately, his responses lacked clarity and were overshadowed by a condescending attitude.

In my attempt to rectify the situation, I approached the billing department, only to be met with conflicting stories. Initially, they claimed no prior communication about a deposit, but later altered their stance, stating that a deposit of Rs. 2, 00, 000 was communicated beforehand without any written and signed estimation.

Feeling cheated and desperate for resolution, I have escalated the matter to the ICMR and consumer forum. I share this experience here not only as a cautionary tale but also to urge everyone to stand against such unethical practices. Let us think beyond money and prioritize ethical medical care over financial gains.

MouthShut,Apollo,"Dear Apollo Team,

The situation you described at Apollo Hospital Navi Mumbai regarding the care of your nephew, Karan Yadav, is concerning. It appears that there was a miscommunication or lack of coordination between the medical staff, leading to confusion and delays in providing the necessary medical attention to your nephew after his accident.

Dr. Tulika Avinash Diwan who was suppose to attend my nephews (Karan Yadav/ 15 years old) who met with accident and is in emergency ward G014. As she told after CT scan report she will start the process but after waiting so many hours, hospital authority Dr. Harsh mentioned she is in OPD and after waiting another hour Dr. Harsh came to me and mentioned.

Please help,

Mukesh Yadav"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Personal experience. Worst treatment. Junior and sadist dr.Karthik from nephrology department ?(+91-996205xxxx?) is behaving like a rowdy and playing with patient's health and experimenting with patient. He will purposely complicate your simple problem by giving you very less insulin(without asking diabetologist) and shift you to MD CCU to grab more and more money from you and make you bankrupt. Even without the need for dialysis, He will purposely start dialysis by threatening you something false and damage your kidneys permanently . He will not advise anything at the time of discharge also. He seems uninterested in his profession. He will make you do dialysis 3 times a week to make regular income from you. Beware of this(so called) doctor Karthik. You will not only lose money, you will also lose your precious health. Senior Dr.kc prakash sir is good. But he's relying and believing this inexperienced and UNPROFESSIONAL karthik."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I am thankful to Dr Vithal D Bagi for the timely advice Dr B Kiran Babu and the team who have given full support and guidance for TAVR procedure of Cardiology department

Special thanks to Ms Pallavi the coordinator too"
MouthShut,Apollo,Dr Meenal Jain was very rude and disrespectful.. it’s a shame for a Dr to have such attitude… infrastructure and service is good but staff and Dr needs to improve their behaviour.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Dr Anand M did not even checked patient, was rude and puts everything on lifestyle.

Hospital charges high fees, ask to pay registration fee separately i was charged 1500 for consultation though told 1200 on phone, even paying so much doctor do not bother stand from his seat to check patient."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Doctors and the nursing staff , especially sister Viji and Labani were very helpful. The management is poor but the staff is great and very supportive."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I am right now at hospital waiting for my turn to get a echo 2d test . The consultation with doctor led to recommendation of this test . First the people manning desks have no clue , no behavioural training - for a place which has patients they casually ask patients to “ go here “ go there “ - no clear instructions , no basic empathy that patients are not in the best of health . After a few running around I finally came to the right place - the absolutely lack of professionalism , no token system of waiting , no clear sense of timing for tests , doctors just walking in with their patients breaking into the queue . A non Indian elderly patient started shouting finally cos he has been waiting till since 11 am and no one has basic courtesy to attend to him to apologise or give him water . And because he started shouting he was taken when it was actually my turn with not so much as chekcing with me !!! This is pathetic - atleast show basic empathy to people who are patients and do not need additional tests . Hospitals with lesser brands and lesser charges have better facilities and better mannered staff as well as doctors . A particular doctor was just using his rank to get in his patients breaking the queue twice . Everyone’s time is important and everyone is suffering - if “ children case “ is going to be used to guilt everyone to break queues pls tell that before taking our money - Apollo first makes us pay bill before any such test is administered. I would like to mention technician Surekha was trying her best but the doctor was simply throwing his weight and breaking the queue to get in his patients -some of these ppl need immediate ICU level training . The non Indian patient being ignored has very legit reason to be upset - and on his behalf k asked the staff “ would you have behaved like this with a white man “ and they had no answer"
MouthShut,Apollo,I take appointment of Dr. Sunil kutty. I taken proper appointment with confirmation. On Dr. Name they take payment after payment neurological dept receptionist said their Secretaries assist you.. If we paid best doctor fees with high amount. They send assistant. 1 st floor physician dept all receptionist are too much rude & not properly guided.. Groud floor Meenakshi MRI dept she aslo talking rudely..
MouthShut,Apollo,"The behaviour of ICU nurses and doctors towards the ICU Patients are very inappropriate and rude, they are paid to do there job, but they act like they are doing some favour to us and the patients if they had issues cleaning the patients or taking care of them, they should have taken a different profession, when they know that in this profession they have to do all such things, then they have to do it."
MouthShut,Apollo,Ms. Sanjana from billing department helped us a lot in our queries and really provided a good service
MouthShut,Apollo,"I will NEVER recommend Apollo to any of my friends or family any time after having such a nightmarish experience last 5 days. So many tests were performed on my 75 year old mother and still there was no proper diagnosis.

My mother had fever and disorientation for which a plethora of tests were suggested and the diagnosis shared was unbelievable.

Brain MRI, CSF, USG, eeg, 2Decho...etc etc and then pet ct scan just becoz everything was clear ..How a Pet CT scan is advised for a 75 year old without any symptoms , findings or a biopsy ???? Unjustifiable

The TPA raised a query in the discharge summary but I don't see any support coming my way and have lost complete trust on medical fraternity....looks like it is a best option not to visit such star hospitals in today's world"
MouthShut,Apollo,"I had an appointment with Dr Senthamil selvi on 22/10/23 her secretary of women's hospital asked me to visit today i.e 23/10/23 after coming the secretary is telling Dr is on leave. I have my flight tonight , I spent 15k for my checkup, we are paying so much and this is what we get . Was not expecting this from the management."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Me and my mother we like the services i like the way the kake care for every thing especially about the daily health of my mum. For sure My God bless ur hands abundantly Nurse, doctor you do a very good job.

Pavni, chongpi may God bless you, keep that golden heart. In few word this department was good, secure, and will be a pressure to be admitted here next time. By have nice job"
MouthShut,Apollo,Medical treatment provided was excellent but the housekeeping service was unsatisfactory. Need improvement. Overall experience was good.
MouthShut,Apollo,"We have been associated with this hospital from 2017 due to certain health issues for my father, the schedule of treatment has been always positive. Experience wrt to the availability of staff / nurse has been really poor off late and the management has to realise they are losing a lot of good resources owing to short recruit"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Pathetic service, no adherence to appointment given, if explained to staff also not bothered even aged pers"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Good staff, Nurse, ward boys and doctors are very responsible and caring. Very rush and full of crowd in emergency ward need to extend their infra structure. Doctors and staffs are working so hard. They diagnose thoroughly and enquiry based. Need improvement in rooms and shifting. Rooms are filled and it took a day to shift."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Doctors are so irresponsible. The doctor who has done the surgery is not involved in the patient care.

Care is horrible than a government hospital. Just money minting."
MouthShut,Apollo,When my cousin was present for a surgery.........the day of discharge was so bad. They were literally extending the process of mediclaim payment and have a huge billing and credential issues. Kindly look forward to it. And improve the staffs working effeciency.
MouthShut,Apollo,"My wife had been admitted in BMT ward for approx 28 days for Bone Marrow Transplant. We were scared before admission but after admission and interaction with nursing staffs, my fear had been vanished. We have been discharged Today (27.09.2023) With good memories in that days. All nursing staffs are very caring and friendly. Special thanks to Vitty sister who has treated like own older sister. Thank you Dr. Punit Sir and Dr. Kanika Madam for giving best treatment to my wife."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Thank you so much for your care and guidance during this incredible experience! We are beyond thrilled.""Thank you again for everything you did to help get our baby here. You were so wonderful to work with during a stressful time and you and your team were supportive and encouraging every step of the way…."
MouthShut,Apollo,I was admitted for one week and was taken care of very well by the entire nursing staff. They were prompt to give attention and provide necessary care.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Incorrect lab results provided to us. Initially few tests were prescribed basis which we had to do additional tests, both the test results were flawed.

I m not sure if they have properly trained lab technicians or not."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo Hospitals is a prominent healthcare group headquartered in India. It operates a network of hospitals and medical facilities, both in India and internationally.

MouthShut,Apollo,Hospital has taken 50000/- as deposit while admitting patient even there is health insurance of recognised company.On the same day of admission patient was discharged but hospital refused to refund remaining balance amount after deducting the bill.. Even after 14 days of rigorous follow up the hospital administration harassed me regarding said refund and asked to call another department for the same... Even now after discharge of patient on 30/07/2023 I have not get refund... The rude and disrespectful behavior of hospital administration frustrated me to see such type of harassment
MouthShut,Apollo,Deepika sister it was a nice experience. You were very cooperative and nice during the whole procedure.
MouthShut,Apollo,"The Apollo hospital has undergone significant changes over the past 5 years. Unfortunately, some employees seem to have adopted a more direct communication style, and certain treatments now require an additional fee. If zero stars were an option, that's the rating I'd give."

Quality of service is far better than other dialysis centers. But the infrastructure is very pathetic. Dialysis machines are old models, congested place, not enough space between beds.

Now a days govt dialysis centers are far better than this. No proper cooling in unit, my father always asks for a fan in a centralized aircondinitioning fecility. And charging Gujarats highest rate for dialysis. This is unacceptable. We are still here in apollo because of doctors and staffs."
MouthShut,Apollo,Gynecology department in Manju sister is a great and caring nurse. She offers helpful advice and suggestions. She is prompt to respond to calls. We have not had any negative interactions with anyone.
MouthShut,Apollo,My words can’t explain how grateful i am to Dr.Richa Bansal and Dr.Anuja Thomas of Apollo Belapur for facing a complicated surgery of mine on June 2023 so smoothly and with utmost care.Thanks a lot to the whole team of Dr.Richa and Dr.Anuja for dedication and hard-work thru out my recovery phase in hospital.I wll never forget the help of whole Apollo team for my rebirth.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo hospital gives nothing compared to the money the charge- Worst nursing staff, worse security rules, etc .The whole point of hospital is to earn money rather than the patient recovery. All this hospital has are 4-5 canteens, all area ac and thats it. They try to make the patients long stay to make money rather than treating them well and discharging. We stayed here for 1 & 1/2 month which resulted to a huge bill of ₹40 lakh and patient DEATH. Would never ever recommend this hosptal to anybody."
MouthShut,Apollo,"The receptionist at radiology department was excellent...and very humble and dedicated to providing high quality standard guidelines and helpful details and directions..

Dr Nita is excellent and explains to patients details with understanding very humble and smart in all she does..good listener and very patient ..

Dr Tikoo .. excellent Dr and his receptionist team..He listens carefully and guides his patient well..he his very humble and gentle

The wellness check up team the best from receptionist to cashiers to labattendees .

The MRI team.. excellent

DrReddy the cardiologist is excellent doctor ..I love the way he handles patients and explains details and very care to listen to patient

Oncology department The best in all areas .

Pharmacy. Attendees great ...but medication abit expensive.

In general The Apollo hospital in Mumbai Navi is one of the best I have ever attended with alot of staff and Doctors team work and giving the patient the best care and support needed ...

They ensure you understand every procedure and guides you from step to step ..They don't rush the patient in giving them meditation...they examine and listen carefully before any drugs are given out ...

They don't undermine patients or shout at them...they handle them with care and love ..

They all carry themselves with alot of professionalism and dedication.

Hospital is clean and well kept

The hospital has best medical equipment and well placed ..

Am happy I had an opportunity to be handled and checked and treated very well at Apollo Navi Mumbai hospital .."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I take this time to say thank you so much for all staffs who works in bone morrow transplant , the Doctors especially Dr punit jain , the nurses and the housekeeping staff for a good services delivery for me when i was sick , the nursing team took great care for me. Iam happy to be discharged.

Thankyou everyone ."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo Hospitals Chennai is totally into business. They are harassing the common people who come from different states of the country. Too expensive treatment. Request to middle class people not to come to this hospital rather visit Vellore. They are doing business at the cost of people's hard earned money. Moreover, local people are given more preference. They are high profile dacoits looting money from people. Very bad experience. They charge a huge amount for a minor operation."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Verry rude staff they don't understand a bit how to talk to the interviewer who comes to us very rude they have no manner disappointment with the recent experience I had at your esteemed institution. I regret to inform you that I encountered multiple instances of staff misbehavior and rudeness during my visit, which has left me deeply disturbed. Firstly, upon arrival at the hospital, I was greeted with an unpleasant attitude from the interviewer . He is very rude

Medical care is good or hospital also but staff as interviewer he is too ?? bad"

MouthShut,Apollo,"Because I had dengue, I went to this hospital. They purposefully reduced AC temperature. I complained about reduced AC temperature, but management has not taken any action. Additionally, they delayed my discharge from hospital by making me weak and removing more blood from my body, which worsened my health, in order to charge me more money. I felt like almost dead. Don't come here, patients are not treated well , but looted by practicing fraud and scam with them."
MouthShut,Apollo,Worst facilities of staff .... The doctors are also so mean nd selfish ... Worst ever hospitals seen
MouthShut,Apollo,I am getting my daughter treated in apollo hospital she is going through chemo therapy the only reason am in this hospital is because of my dr Vipin Khandelwal the best pediatric hematologist the stafff doesn’t know what they are doing we have to call multiple times for change of medicine for a simple urine test it takes 1. :30 min and that to I chased it or else’s god know when would I be able to get the reports please improve your services nurses are very important for patients and it’s important that they know what they are doing

MouthShut,Apollo,Service in apollo 44 is pathetic patients have to wait for everything for 2 3 hrs. No water is provided on time. And not satisfaction treatment too many side effects but no result. Only people money time getting waste.
MouthShut,Apollo,"A professional and empathetic ICU environment with a lot of thought given to caretakers in addition to patients. Typical ICU duty environments for caretakers can be stressful, with trying to get information on the patient in the ICU, or staying overnight at the hospital. I found that at Apollo Belapur, solutions to a lot of these concerns were thought through and taken care of. The security was professional enough to stick with hospital rules about ICU visitation, and at the same time empathetic enough to handle all caretakers respectfully. Special call out to Samir Bhilare on this front, and additionally for prompt communication in calling the caretaker when doctors required the medical history of the patient or to update the caretaker about the patient’s progress. Apollo also has a great attendant resting area, complete with perhaps 20 or more beds, each equipped with its own bedside lamp, a pillow and a plug point, as well as clean restrooms and bathrooms. It’s a great model in ICU attendant/caretaker management for other hospitals to follow."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Worst hospital providing fake treatment in huge cost. This is regarding surgical treatment of my husband Gaurav Shrivastava done on 21-Mar-2023 (hospitalization from 20-Mar-2023 to 22-Mar-2023). He had taken treatment for “Kidney stone removal” from Apollo Hospital, Belapur Navi Mumbai. As per the initial CT scan test report (dated 20-Mar-2023), 2 stones were present in left kidney which were 7 mm each in size and one in the right kidney of 14mm size.

He underwent a surgery on 21-Mar-2023. After surgery, the doctors informed that the stones have been removed and in Discharge Summary same was mentioned that stones have been broken by laser lithotripsy and removed from the left Kidney and the stone of the right kidney was powdered and then bilateral DJ stenting was done. He was discharged on 22-Mar-2023 (stents were to be kept for 3-4 weeks). In the medical bill, all these procedures have been charged for both the kidneys.

Now, we contacted another Physician for “Removal of DJ stents” since the price in Apollo was very high and this new physician suggested to undergo a CT scan (at any diagnostic centre of our choice) before this procedure. As per the CT scan report (dated 10-Apr-2023), it was identified that the stones are still present in both the kidneys (one 7mm stone in left kidney and one 14mm stone in right kidney) and even the size of the stones were also same (size was same as that of the CT scan dated 20-Mar-2023).

That means the surgical treatment provided by Apollo Hospital was fake and is a case of medical negligence and fraud.

As per my current Physician recommendation, I will again have to undergo a surgery to remove the stones along with “Removal of DJ stent” and a new stent will be placed.

This has affected my husband, me and my family members gravely in all aspects- mentally, physically, and financially. I have paid a huge amount for this treatment around 3 lakhs (3 days hospitalization) and my husband had tolerated so much pain and blood loss (during and after procedure) but the medical issue has not been resolved.

As Apollo didn’t provide a proper treatment, my husband will again need a surgery for “Removal of Kidney stones”.

I asked the hospital that, based on my complaint, Apollo management should take action against all the doctors involved in this fake treatment scam and I want refund of all the amount that I have paid along with compensation for the mental and physical trauma that me and my family members have suffered. However, just like their doctors the management is negligent too.

Now, I am going to take a legal action against Apollo Hospital and its responsible medical staff and posting this to warn everyone that this hospital runs scams and frauds in treatment."
MouthShut,Apollo,"This is the right platform to share my experience about the treatment we got for my mother.

My mother had been diagnosed with high risk AML and her condition was very critical as she had fever since last 20 days before her admission. We were so blessed to have Dr. Punit the right person who can treat and cure this on time with his great decision making ability and with his amazing BMT team. My mother got right treatment from right person at right time. thanks much Dr. Punit for treating my mother so well we wouldn’t have imagined this journey without you."

MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo Hospitals is one of the best I have ever visited, My grand father had tuberculosis and underwent treatment here. He recovered in a year. The services provided are good. they have the latest equipments, laser technologies, xray rooms, modern diagnostics. The doctors are also quite good in their specialization and knowledge. The only problem is it is too costly for a common man, so be ready to spend enough to get the best services."

MouthShut,Apollo,"Security mr Arjun patil and his team was very helpful for during my relatives in hospitalisation.

Thank you for your support"
MouthShut,Apollo,He is the reason for my dad's death. He showed no attention. He never spoke clearly about his condition. I am sure the stent surgery done by him was a failure and the reason for my dad's death. They just want money. I will never recommend Appollo and especially Dr. Roshan Rao for any of your family members life. He just disappeared as soon as my dad passed away as if he was guilty.

MouthShut,Apollo,"My Dad was admitted in Emergency due to sudden confusion and transient memory loss. The emergency doctor figured out it is due to hypoglycemia and as a precautionary measure CT scan and MRI of brain was done and found to be normal. My dad also regained consciousness in 3 hrs but he was admitted in ICU for one day for observation. Then they took Ultrasound(kidney), Blood test package, Urine test, Thyroid stimulating hormone test, Dengue, H1N1, Oxygen(though he is breathing on his own) etc.The final bill is 1.5 lakhs for 3 days. If we worried more about the health status our relations it is very nicely harvested by the hospitals."
MouthShut,Apollo,Everything fantastic thank you.. best treatment.. but Some dr Assistant are crezy.. like dr n Ragavan assistant lady didn't know discipline and responsibility.. she didn't maintain proper need Learning ya change the assistant for better..

Very poor Management, full of confusion, many staffs are highly demotivated & disgruntled. Money collection is fast but all other systems & process very unsatisfactory. Apollo Hospital, Chennai has become business centre rather than Hospital . Reviews not working properly and giving good remarks but I want to give poor remarks"
MouthShut,Apollo,"They put alcohol n nicotine withdrawal on the discharge summary!!!! This after raking up a bill of 13 lakhs! My husband last had a drink 2 months before his hospitalization, and they were aware of it. We also did a toxicology test that came negative for everything. I fail to understand how they run the place and call it a hospital. If you can't leave your loved one in an ICU and be confident about it, who can you trust? After all, your visiting hours are so limited, that your loved one is literally at their mercy! The MD CCU in Sindhoori block has cockroaches roaming around. They bill you for a nutritionist, when the entire job of planning the daily diet is done by you. They suggest you get a special nurse from Apollo home care while the patient is in ICU. The charges are 4 times of what you would normally pay outside. My husband supposedly had a VIP status and this was the state of affairs, I shudder to think of what happens to patients who don't know anyone there. It was a nightmarish experience and one that has convinced me to look for alternate medicine/ healing. I should not have shifted my husband from Chettinad Hospital. The team there was far more professional and sensitive. Possibly they could be requested to train the Team here! I must take this opportunity to thank Mrs. Manohar for her unbiased support, attendants Janardhan and Lavanya who took excellent care of my husband and Abdul and Aunjan who reassured me while I waited outside the MDCCU that my husband would be okay. I have to give credit where it is due."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Very very Worst emergency service

For a fever 103 after iron injection they made us wait for more than 5 hours

All doctors are jus roaming here and there

Real horrible service by emergency doctors"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo hospital is very clean and maintenence are good, their staff doctor are very friendly to all.and one thing I liked very much that 70 percent medicine are availaval in hospital."

MouthShut,Apollo,Very supportive staff Mr Sameer thank you very much for being so kind and understand the every situation while visiting to the hospital... thank you once again
MouthShut,Apollo,"Before my surgery visiting doctor came into my room and asked me to sit back while I am resting . He doesn't know what I have been through before admitting. When I was trying to sit back he said to the junior doc or nurse

""She is obese"" .Yes I am . I know that . Talking like that infront of a patient is rude and a worse behaviour for a doctor . Its been years but still I can hear his words, which hurts me a lot . Better management teach the visiting doctors how to behave . Nobody have a right to insult me like that . Even I can tell him at that time itself. But I have respect , may be he doesn't. I gave staff one star , it applies only if the mentioned doc is there otherwise staff was very good except him . Doctors or Management, ""Learn to respect everyone"" ."
MouthShut,Apollo,Appollo Hospital was the best as I had experience not only in hospitalized but also in heart.Personally I would thank Mr Shyam for helping us in all the emergency requirement. No words Your service is super.God bless this hospital as well as all the doctors N staff ..

Horrible experience..

Haven't liked their services ..

Once doctor says discharge they are concerned about the billing and not services"
MouthShut,Apollo,"I had an operation on 7th December. Before getting admitted, during admission and post admission facilities were very good."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Docters are good but worst admin staff i ever witnessed. I was admitted for 2 days at Apollo jubli hills and now I have decided to never choose Apollo for hospitalization purpose and won't recommend either. They will make you sick again during discharge time. Payment and insurance dept. persons are egoistic, rude and ilmannerd. Seems like they don't have families or humanity. Worst hospitality ever."
MouthShut,Apollo,My father was admittedfor back pain n spine surgery. The pre operative investigationwas carriedoutspeedily smoothly n efficiently. The surgerywas a successthanks to Dr Sajan Hegde .my father is recoveringwell.Hats off to Dr .Sajan and his team

Murugan, the catering manager very often visited us to know about our needs.

MouthShut,Apollo,"Very very expensive hospital even with corporate insurence will not cover the money thirst of Apollo.

Here doctor are set with money traget to dig deep hole from patient pocket and heart.

Nurse and other technical staff are only working with humanity that's y single star they are also paid less and motivated with job abroad.

Never go to Apollo you may get cured but killed with bill also forced to sell all your property and saving in single admission"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Hospital sent wrong billing to insurance and didn't steps to fix it patient has to wait 24 hours in hospital to get discharge, neglect answer by billing team"
MouthShut,Apollo,Had an appointment at 1.30 pm and got to see doctor at 3pm . Staff doesn’t know whose number is next . Doctor Vaishali Mam is good . Waiting for an appointment kills everything. ER staff is very rude doesn’t listen to patient and patient’s relative.
MouthShut,Apollo,I arrived from the Uk this morning and went to to Apollo hospital to have an annual check up. I was pleasantly surprised by the improved international reception leaded by Rafi MHC and the assistance given by Saikrishna and Jyothi who accompanied me throughout my 4 ½ hour stay. Many thanks to all the staff.
MouthShut,Apollo,It is managed very unprofessionally and apazard way. Patients are made to wait and move from one place to another ..X Ray and Ultrasound not working ... Consultation Doctor with attitude..
MouthShut,Apollo,Worst experience.Booked appointment 3 times and all these have been cancelled by Dr. Shoba sudeep. Tried to solve the issue with customer support team but failed .
MouthShut,Apollo,"Had my moms umbilical hernia repair done in Apollo hosp, Mumbai.

I had high hopes from the hospital considering the amount charged and the brand name but hospital is like getting treated in a government hosp where u are considered stupid and treated as if you are being treated without a penny.

No clear directions when you get admitted and once you get admitted you are just left unattended. If the bystander is capable, your patient will be ok.No one orients to ward/ noone informs the numbers u need to call for simple things like pillow.Infection control is a joke- saw IV bottles pricked by pen for air vent!!!As a nursing educator for last 15 years in India and abroad, I had to force myself to keep quiet so that I am not labelled as a “difficult relative”.No one uses alcohol gel/ washes hand between patient contact.

Nurses are over worked and stressed and I really feel for them but that doesn't mean I as a relative has to bear below standard care for my mom.I have never treated any patient/ client in India or abroad the way we were treated.

The surgical team was good but still they sometimes talk to you the way you speak to uneducated person- all patients need to be treated with compassion/ care irrespective of the caste/ education/creed.Not sure if this was because we were on a general ward( we paid 2, 20, 000 for 2 day stay though!!!).Bystanders are given a plastic chair- how on earth are u supposed to get a wink on that chair???

Before discharge , we were asked verbal feedback by a lady but no provision informed to write a review.No-one explains the care after surgery- what about people who don't have any medical knowledge??

I am grateful for the surgery done and I am sure we will be ok but but when you charge so much from patients, I think u can expect at least a minimal standard care.I wish all the team of Apollo all the best and hope that they will have more kindness in future."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I have had a worst experience with the service. I have admitted my brother to apollo hospitals, Hyderguda. No patient care. Highly charged for minimal treatment. I never recommend this hospital to anyone."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I took my sister for medical treatment in India everybody told me it's the best place to go ok we went, mhhh the International patient team Obaid, Krishna and Udit were very good, over worked I use to do a lot myself because there running around like headless chicken, Dr Ketul Shah and Dr Purushottam were very good but over worked you would thought because ur international patient you will get priority because you paying a lot of money but no your in the que with all the locals and 90% of the whole hospital staff don't speak English, very rude not co-operative, There is no system like ur in a que somebody will come from no where and pass in front of u, and when they know ur international patient first thing they ask money, money money money only for them, my sister was admitted and I had to pay deposit before admission and after discharge there was a refund it took me the whole day to get my refund they waste a lot of time for patient when we go like 11am and leave at around 5pm my sister was very weak could stay there for long and another thing the doctor will tell me something else and the nurses and receptionist will say something else how can they know when they don't even speak English, I think Apollo should employ English speaking staff if they want to get more patient from abroad.

What I like mostly about it is the guest house which we rented from Ashok he was a good host with his team they provide transport too from guest to hospital and back Thank you Ashok team."
MouthShut,Apollo,"All treatments excellent and staff behaviour and way to talk good. All treatment also. specialy food taste and hot and on time services, overall good experience in Apollo hospital. Thank you.."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Dr Sujith Kumar and team neurologist are very excellent doctors, who treated me. All the services and staffs are very good. Thanks to everyone those who are all taken care of me. I promptly suggest Apollo hospital Sheshadripuam"
MouthShut,Apollo,"They keep patient in non icu ward for most of the time and keep patient in icu for 2 to 3 hrs and charge icu charges 24hrs they give reason as non availability of icu

Discharge process is horrible sonu madam took 6 hrs to send bill for approval n total bill was not disclosed even asking repeatatively

No dietician but they give generic diet chart with only name changed sex remains same for everyone"
MouthShut,Apollo,Me and my mother are having fever and wanted to take an appointment with a physician. I have called Apollo Hyderguda branch to book an appointment for General Physician. I have called them multiple times and Everytime the call was put on hold and later disconnected. I can hear their staff laughing loud with out addressing patients concern. This is very unprofessional.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Appointment is done in bulk and patients have to weight for 3/4 hrs to see Drs, the staff is not at all concerned about the patients…."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Since from last 3 days my family member is in ICU. Nither staff nor doctor is keeping us informed about the health conditions atleast once in a day, and the attending doctor punctuality and timing doesn't have that and worried to ask for doctor change and hospital change because it's life and the this hospital is not really serious about the life except money money.. I will keep updating the things here"
MouthShut,Apollo,"My mother was admitted to the ICU because Dr. Prasad, the oncologist, consulted at that awful hospital. All the hospital was concerned about was making money. The oncology nurses did not look after the dignity of my mother. Hate this hospital. Would give it zero star review."
MouthShut,Apollo,"The doctors OPD is in the basemet and no wash room in the basemet...doctors will fear you and advice for costly test... wen all payment done not concerned. Treatment not ok.

Gynae department is worst...dr Monica Mallik and Dr vineeta are not Ok.. rude... think as if they know everything being Doctor.. she gave me contraceptive tablets...

I shown un Pune to Gynae, she said these tests were not required.. and gave a simple medicine...

So i will not prefer the Apollo Noida nor advise for Dr Monica Mallik and Dr Vineeta"
MouthShut,Apollo,Making appointment is useless here. I had an appointment everytime I costed. But still gotta wait with the people haven’t got an appointment. I recommend gleneagles . Much more customer friendly
MouthShut,Apollo,"Hello everyone

Few months back my cousin nishant residing at Ratangiri was having pain at his lower abdomen and the doctors there had suggested few tests to be done to check and diagnose the same which was possible only in mumbai.however my cousin and relatives tried various hospitals for the tests to be conducted but mostly due to covid/ staff issues couldn’t get the dates.

My cousin called me for the same and updated me that the test were to be conducted on urgent basis but hardly any hospital was available to do it."
MouthShut,Apollo,"My ID is AC01.0002494462 . On 12/07/2022 I was appointed with Dr. M Hariharan and I was asked to do full body checkup and endoscopy, colonoscopy. For that I did my full body checkup on 13/07/2022. There I met Dr. Bhaskar. He became angry without any reason. Nextday even he scolded me without knowing me and my problem. Lastly I under stood that his behaviour was due to Dr. M Hariharan. His assistant 3-4 times repeats that myself is patient of Dr M Hariharan. But so far my knowledge concern Dr Bhaskar is a medicine specialist and my problem was gastro. So I met Dr M Hariharan. That means we can't take appointment of other doctor. I am sorry to say all this thing about your doctor's behaviour. Please put your best attention on such type of circumstances."
MouthShut,Apollo,"It has not been my experience in Appolo Noida but post Pandemic, Front office are ridiculous and bllshitter. They are highly manipulative, no logic behind what she says and no attention to the old patient. My wife went for a preventive check up, charged more than what it is written on their website, took 4 days to get report. When she reached there to collect the report, they kept her on hold for 2 hours. One of the staff took her receipt and flee from there for indefinite amount of time. We wasted another day to collect the report and Dr. went away for the day and now will have to wait for another day. I strongly suggest people to go to Saral Diagnostics in Noida for preventive health check. At least, in Noida, I found Saral Diagnostics much better than others."
MouthShut,Apollo,"It was my bad experience about Dr. I thought I will get best treatment in Chennai apollo hospital so that I came here.I got dr.jameels appointment.he done my operation on 12th july.after operation I felt so much pain .I told may times to the nurse that iam in major painplz call the doctor and paracetamol not working plz give me other tablet.but no one hear.i was in pain from 8:30 pm to next day 6:30 pm. Lastly I told my husband to give me zerodol sp.afyer that I got relief from my pain.

I was very hurt when doctor told me don't teach me I gave same treatment and medecine to everyone then how r u in pain . Dr Jameel and his junior dr.all treated very rudely. When I went on 15 july for dressing my cut.doctor not came and send someone. I think it was every doctor 's duty to treat his patients nicely.but I was very disappoint.i suggest everyone that don't go there.i think it was my major mistake to choose Chennai than

Guwahati."
MouthShut,Apollo,I went to Apollo because It’s a big brand and people trust it. But since day one my experience with Apollo Gandhinagar is nothing less but traumatic. The staff is only helpful if you are a corporate patient. I’m a CGHS patient so dispote available appoint slots for OPD I was told I can’t see the doctor before 2. So I waited . Then during billing the staff is so incompetent that to bill one person it’s taking 20 minutes. It literally took me an hour to get the bill and once my file was with the concern doctor she didn’t even let me tell her my issues. She just saw the reports and wrote some medicines and bye bye no time to ask her something. I know doctors are highly overburdened but just because the patients is CGHS one the whole hospital staff as well the doctors don’t treat you with a little bit of empathy is totally wrong. If you are paying them 1500 consultation then they will give you time else if you are a CHGS patient like me you should expect the doctor to even hear you .
MouthShut,Apollo,"My husband has got operated for umbilical hernia day before yesterday here. My experience was good. We both are very satisfied with all services provided by the hospital. Staff was very humble and co-operative. Food, hygiene, helpers, other facilities etc. are quite satisfactory. No complaints from any corner. I would love to recommend the same hospital to my nears and dears in case of any medical emergency and give 5 stars for their healthy atmosphere which they are providing to their patients."
MouthShut,Apollo,"All the staff members at apollo were greatly helpful for getting my medical done today.At first, when I reached there, looking at such a huge number of people, I got tensed as I had taken a day off from my job.I thought it was impossible to get it done today itself! But then Mr. Parth Prajapati helped me get it done so smoothly and efficiently that I was then relieved as It is difficult to get one more day leave from my job.Hearty Thanks to Mr. Parth Prajapati and all the staff members at Apollo.??????"
MouthShut,Apollo,They are greatly working cleanliness is on topnice behavioursupporting staffApolo is the choice
MouthShut,Apollo,"I had gone for my mother for an Ortho issue . We had an appointment of 1:30 pm and we reached well in time. However even though registration and every was done we still had to wait for an hour almost due to poor management by the staff .

When we asked they gave an excuse that they are prioritising critical patients which was lame as there was no one as such and even if there was some critical case it can’t be that multiple people ahead of us will be allowed who had a later appointment. Reception also doesn’t behave properly. This really spoils image of Apollo and moreover inconvenience for patients who pay a hefty amount for apollo brand for pathetic service"
MouthShut,Apollo,Worst management. Staffs sitting in counters are behaving very rudely. No respect for patients and people. High cost. Only rich people can afford. There is no sufficient chairs for patients and people to sit.5 to 10 doctors are in a confined space rooms. Any fire or incident breakout can lead to a very big disaster. Costs of medicines in Apollo pharmacy are 20% more compared to outside shops.
MouthShut,Apollo,"My daughter admitted in apollo karapakkam under consideration of Dr Harish V S for UTI and in serious condition but Dr Harish no words to say what miracle he have once we talk with Doctor we are fully satisfied he given not only medically as well as mentally support to us. His explaining skill about diagnosis, amazing. If I will write about him , Oh my God I need so much space here and whole day, he is simply amazing. So finally coming to my bad experience, I don't know about daily basis but on that day when I came in emergency with my daughter behavior of nurses were very bad and irresponsible.overall come to apollo hospital karrappakkam for Dr harish VS definitely."
MouthShut,Apollo,"My wife had a second delivery with c section, since she had her first as c section . Since its is planned c section and we planned do family planning as well .

Since I am from health back round and already they are doing a c section and it will be easier do tubectomy in the table itself .

I was shocked they charged for C Section as a surgical procedure and charged a surgical procedure for Tubectomy as well .

It was very painful and hospital staff argued and charged as 2 surgical procedure - which was not the case .

I discussed this with consultant, who performed this, she agreed with me and told she even raised it multiple times .

Already the charge premium and we pay expecting we get better quality .

Bigger brand like Apollo - we expect they operate with ethics and do thing which is right ."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Oncology Jubilee hills , i would like to give review on oncology nurses are excellent , they take of my husband in an empathetic professional way, I would to mention names like kalpana, Priya, Sony,"

Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient thanks for appolo group to find such responsible doctors"
MouthShut,Apollo,Worst staff...not at all responding in calls..should improve a lot...respond to patients needs......
MouthShut,Apollo,"Good infrastructure with latest technology and medical equipments , Friendly and cooperative staff ."
MouthShut,Apollo,Ms. Vineetha from the health check up team is amazing at people management and is very diligent and efficient at her work. She really was patient with everyone around and articulate.
MouthShut,Apollo,I asked th online for tricagrelor brilionto tablets 56 for one month. it is originally a Sweden manufacturing with bangalore company marketting. but to my utter surprise they billed rs.1680 and sent me the wrong meicine of sunpharma with low quality product. when I asked for they said this can not be replaced. how they are cheating the customers by sending the low quality proucts and substantiates that the medicine is not exchanagable. all cheatttttttttttttttttt.dont purchase meicine through apollo. if it is the case of educated people what about illiterates who buy medicine blindly.
MouthShut,Apollo,"It's a wonderful experience of health checkup.The receptionist, staff, doctors & nurse's are very polite, decent in communication.

It was completely hassle-free.

Thanks to Apollo hospital.

Keep doing good work."
MouthShut,Apollo,"My father's Knee replacement operation has been done by K C Mehta. Would like to recommend each and every one to prefer apollo hospital and doc.Proper care was provided pre and post operation.Had a wonderful experience at every step management of the hospital is too good and even more wonderful were all the people here. Excellent care was provided including house keeping to the food service, all left us with a good experience. I would highly recommend this hospital.

Most Importantly: Once you enter here you are totally free.. You don't have to run for anything not even on your discharge formalities. Each and Every person know there responsibility and will take care of it."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Before I start my review, I would just like you to know the doctors are very good as well as the staff, the only problem is with the management/financial departments.

Only the infrastructure of the hospital is good, everything regarding the management and financial department is the worst.

If you have insurance and need any sort of immediate treatment/surgery/diagnosis, especially on Saturdays and Sundays, DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL.

The system is designed to exploit, worry and giving a headache to the patient.

We had insurance and they said that TPA(Insurance Related Department) is closed on sunday but when we started to talk about discharge purposes, they immediately sent the claim to the insurance company, but when the company asks for further details, they say that the TPA department is closed on Sundays.

This is such a flawed system, and it is direct dogalapan, and I will highly suggest you, if possible do not go to such hospitals, they are designed in such a way to get the most amount of money out of you.

And if you need to go anyway, then go on weekdays and go early (before 5/6 PM) and get your insurance cleared beforehand or just dont go to these hospitals."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Made the right decision to come to Apollo Hospital, Bhat for mother's TKR (both knees). Had a wonderful experience at every step of the process and even more wonderful were all the people here. Genuine, warm and excellent care was provided - the surgery, the post op care and all the staff involved - from house keeping to the food service, all left us with a good experience. I would highly recommend this hospital."
MouthShut,Apollo,Management and employees taking mobile from patients giving 5 star rating to hospital(without patients feedback)
MouthShut,Apollo,"Hi Myself dr Payal Kamble mbbs, ms ent, fellow head and neck surgical oncology and I went to Apollo Mumbai branch ..i wanted to meet Dr harshal department of ENT with the reference of my senior consultant regarding any job vacancy available in the department or available in the future ..i was not even allowed to enter the gate...they initially asked me to make a gate pass for which I was ready and then they denied that and asked me to contact hr department only den they will make the pass...i called the department and they said no we don't have a job requirement. ..i was not even allowed to make entry in the hospital which is fine as that must be the protocol...but being a doctor I felt humiliated...i guess if it would have been otherwise they would have called the doctor rude... worst experience ever...I had been to many India's best hospital.. but never got a treatment like this"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Courteous and polite staff, great doctors, overall experience is good. Super specialist are also available"
MouthShut,Apollo,"Visited ASHA MAHILMARAN(cardiologist) for irregular heartbeat and palpitation issues.

Asked to perform tests, Echo and 24hr Holter. Total cost; ₹14000(incl. her fees). This also includes ""Professional Charges"" of ₹1500.

Aren't the tests supposed to include ""Professional Charges""? Are the tests done without professional help? Do we perform the tests on our own? Does that make sense?

Even the so-called cardiologist was not at all helpful. She had nothing concrete to help. For the irregular heartbeat, her advice; visit a psychiatrist(?)

Ultimately, we got nothing of value after spending so much money.

What kind of ""doctor"" and greedy place is this?"
MouthShut,Apollo,Customer care executives are not attending the calls properly and they are not providing valid information.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Doctor caring : Especially Dr. Sandheep M Reddy was excellent ?? in receiving patients and medical care .Staff nurses were also caring . House keeping staff also seems good .

Finally security people required some attention towards patients and attenders of respected patients w.r.t #Humanity @@@ soft handling ."
MouthShut,Apollo,All Service is good& no time westing . Pro health team give good Guidence to every new patient.
MouthShut,Apollo,"I was attendant to my mother in law and she was admitted on 17/01/22 for a leg fracture surgery. A million thanks to Dr C B Prabhu, Dr Chetan and other staff for successful surgery and post operative care. The infrastructure and processes in the hospital are excellent. Special thanks to Ms Richa Sinha and Mr Devaraj for their empathy and assisting me to resolve billing challenges. F & B service is excellent and they really take of patients. A big thank you to all the teams in the hospital."
MouthShut,Apollo,I visited apollo medical Centre kondapur for my health check reports. Swapna she informed us to collect reports and given doctors consultation to me and my friends. She helped very well she is quite good
MouthShut,Apollo,"They charge more and doesn't even care patients, as they treat as we were in government hospital, worst management and administration billing itself will give us heart stroke"
MouthShut,Apollo,"My relative has been shifted to ACCU for the critical condition.

Dr Hasan Ali, the incharge of ACCU, doesn't have communication sense et al.

Instead of helping to understand the patient's condition, instead he asks us to explain what is understood.

He isn't updated with diagnosis reports and if we ask about the test and report, he don't have its answer and keeps on saying it's irrelevant.

He is very arrogant and tries to feel how wrong you are, not being medico.

But the doctor fails to understand every patient/relative can't be a medico.

He himself doesn't know too many things for the patient's condition he's treating.

Instead he's lot interested in your profession.

As a doctor, he is neither concerned with patient's condition nor makes relatives properly understand patient's condition clearly.

He's big shame as a Doctor. Never saw such un-human doctor before."
MouthShut,Apollo,Very very bad service. Apollo chennai hospital they are only do business not a treatment. Only docter tell test or test. No one come here go to Bangalore any hospital. Ye sirf mera sath nhi ye problem sab sath horah yeha. I talk 10-15 people every one said same thing they are doing only business.out of 10 I will give 00.
MouthShut,Apollo,Billing even in OPD takes 30 minutes due to slow server and increase in number of patients. Average delay of 30 minutes to one hour behind scheduled appointment time is usual.
MouthShut,Apollo,"Don't go to this Hospital. One star also wast. there is no human doctors. Doctors Can't understand patient simple Problems and they give ""WRONG TREATMENT"" ( it was simple pneumonia for me but Doctors Started giving Covid 19 Treatment to get more money) for me they charged 1, 27, 000 INR for one day. Horrible experience with Doctors and Hospital staff. (as per my Family members suggestion i went to another Hospital and taken treatment the Doctor give me one tablet and one injection for 3 days i am fully recovered in just cost 10, 000 INR with all required test and Treatment).

Very important thing is Most of the doctors are animal doctors (Please check below picture one of the doctor (not nurse) done RT PCR test for me. my nose, two holes between sensitive flesh cut and bleading because of animal practices they do) also look at what kind of food they give. If someone join Please get your food Don't take Hospital food.

@ I begg each and everyone to help me. where i can give Complaint against this Hospital. i have all the evidence.

As a responsible citizen i would like to save others life Please help me and support. Thank you all.

@Apollo Hospital managment let us know what action are you going to take. Also post your action in front of the public."
MouthShut,Apollo,"They give good treatment, but before that lots of test and checkup is done which took whole day or 2 days. Each test is very costly, just for 5 days bill will be more than 1 lakh. Waste of Time and money."
MouthShut,Apollo,"I have a appointment with Rajeev Annigeri specialist Nephrology but without any Doctor visiting one of his assistant he make report and ask for test report and all..they took unnecessary one day for Ultrasound, blood and urine test. Really so bad experience....next day I went with my all reports but that day also same waiting waiting..I report on 10am but doctors security is telling come at 3 O'clock..they never think about you..my suggestion is don't go to Apollo you can choice others hospital otherwise same issue you will get..and it's not only happened with me if you ask all the patient they will tell you. I will never go to Apollo and Reting of staff zero what they think about their self don't know."
MouthShut,Apollo,"Apollo means wastage of money, time and energy. They focuses on different tests than treatment. You cannot consult a doctor before the test. The receptionist will give a long list of test and than the patient has to visit counter to counter with 100 to 150 long quoue for the test to be done. Again for reports from 6A counter you will have to visit for two days. They are just leeches, will suck out your remaining blood. Better to choose some other hospital."
MouthShut,Apollo,"It was an unpleasant experience at Apollo hospitals. Never expected such a level treatment for patients. It was like a village hospital. The nursing staff are over worked, hence they are not able to give attention to patients. The ICU should have a dedicated nurse for each patient. But they have one nurse for 2 or 3 patients. The total bill for 12 days is Rs 8 lakhs. Out of which Rs.4 lakhs is pharmacy bill. Just can't understand how much the patient is drugged. It a sorry state of affairs and I will not recommend Apollo hosp to any of my family and friends. The only motive of the hospital or doctors is to only charge patients put them in ICU even when it is not required. Once they know that the patient has insurance they finish off the patient."
JustDial,Apollo,"I visited Apollo Home Health Care Ltd for a routine check-up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The department was clean and hygienic, which made me feel safe during my visit. The wait time for my appointment was less than one hour, making the whole experience very efficient."
JustDial,Apollo,Its a good hospital. And staff also very good and humble person.
